<h2>Preface</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN the preparation of this volume the aim in view has
been to tell the story of Jesus Christ in a manner
that will be attractive to both young and old, to
children and their teachers. While the purpose of the
writer has been to adapt the narrative to the understanding
of a child of ten years, so that he will not need to
ask the meaning of a sentence or a word: yet it has
also been his desire to make it not childish, but simple,
so that older readers may find it interesting and
profitable.</div>

<p>In order that this book may not lead its younger
readers or listeners away from the Bible, but directly
toward it, no imaginary scenes or conversations have
been introduced. The design has been to write the
biography of Jesus, not a romance founded upon his life.</p>

<p>The order of events has been carefully considered;
and follows that of the best authorities, accepting as
historical <i>all</i> the four gospels and <i>all</i> their contents;
raising no questions concerning miracles or the relative
values of different portions of the record. The first
purpose of every student or reader of the Bible, whether
young or old, should be to become thoroughly familiar
with its contents. Without a full knowledge of the
Scriptures as they are, he is absolutely unfit to cope
with the questions of authorship or the credibility of the
sacred writings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>No attempt has been made to formulate from the
record of Christ's life a doctrinal system. Theology is
the loftiest study for the human intellect; but it belongs
to the mature mind, not to the realm of childhood. Nor
has it been the writer's aim to find in this story moral
lessons for the young. The works and words of Jesus
will make their own application to their reader, whether
they be children or adults.</p>

<p>The typography, the illustrations, and the mechanical
execution of such a work as this are of almost equal
importance with its literary material. All that diligent
effort, artistic taste, and abundant resources can do to
make this book attractive and helpful to its readers, has
been done by the Publishers.</p>

<p>That this volume may awaken a new interest in
that Life of lives, which has brought the light of life to
untold millions since it was lived upon the earth: that
the children of this generation, who are to become the
pillars of the coming years, may learn to love and follow
Him who is the Elder Brother and Saviour of us all, is
the prayer of the author of these pages.</p>

<h2>Why Everybody Should Know the Life
of Christ</h2>


<div class='cap'>THERE HAVE been many famous men in this
world, and every one wishes to know who they
were and why they are called great. In almost
every city in America may be seen a statue of George
Washington, or Abraham Lincoln, or Benjamin Franklin,
or General Lee, or General Grant. Whenever you see
one of these statues, you ask&mdash;if you do not know already&mdash;who
this man was and why his statue has been set up.
In Canada, every house has on the wall a portrait of
the great and good Queen Victoria, and when a child
sees it he wishes to know something of her life and her
greatness. You see pictures of a man standing on the
deck of a ship, or going ashore under palm trees on an
island, and are told that he is Christopher Columbus&mdash;and
every child in America knows something of his
story. Men like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Julius Caesar,
and Alexander the Great, are written about, and talked
about; and every child should know who these men
were and why they are famous.</div>

<p>Did you ever think that there is one man who has
been talked about, and written about, and sung about,
more than any other man in all the world; and that man
is Jesus? For one book telling of Washington, or Napoleon,
or Columbus, there are hundreds of books telling
of Jesus. Every year at least fifteen million copies of
the Bible are printed and sent out into the world, in
every language spoken on this earth. Why does everybody
wish to have a Bible in his house? It is because
that book tells of Jesus. If the pages that tell of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
should be torn out of the Bible, few people would care
to have it or to read it.</p>

<p>There are more portraits of Jesus Christ, painted
and drawn and printed, than of any other man who has
ever lived. Everybody knows the picture of Jesus
as soon as he sees it, whether it be of the baby Jesus in
his mother's arms, or the boy Jesus in the Temple, or
the Saviour teaching, or dying upon the cross. You do
not need to be told which one in any picture is Jesus&mdash;his
face is so well known that you know it at once. No
other face among all the men who have ever lived from
Adam the first man down to today, is known to as many
people as the face of Jesus. Then, too, look in the hymn
books of the churches and the song books of the Sunday-schools,
and see how many of the hymns and songs are
in praise of Jesus Christ. You do not find songs in
praise of Julius Caesar, nor of Christopher Columbus,
nor even of George Washington. No one who gives it
thought doubts that the most famous man in all the
world is Jesus Christ; and because he is so famous and
so great, every one should know something of his life.</p>

<p>Then, too, everybody likes to hear stories of wonderful
things. Even though we know that they are not
true stories, every one listens to fairy tales and the
stories of the "Arabian Nights." But how often, when
the story is ended, the child looks up to the story-teller's
face and says, "Is it all true?" Now, the story of Jesus
is full of wonders. You read of his turning water into
wine when the guests at the feast needed it, of his touching
the eyes of a blind man and giving him sight, of his
speaking to the storm and bringing peace, of his walking
upon the waters in another storm to help his friends in
danger, and, most wonderful of all, of his coming out
of his own tomb living, after he had died. Wonderful
indeed are the stories told of Jesus; and the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wonder is that they are all true. You would like to hear
those stories, I am sure; and every child should know
them and be able to tell them to others.</p>

<p>Let me give you another reason why every one
should know the story of Jesus. He came to show us
who God is, what God is to us, and how God feels toward
us. Every one, even every child, thinks of God and in
his heart wishes to know about God. How terribly
some people have mistaken God! They have thought
of him as an enemy, not as a friend. You can see in
some countries images of a person with forty arms, and
on every hand something to kill a man with&mdash;a sword,
a spear, an arrow, a club, a cup of poison, or some other
fearful thing&mdash;and that is the thought of God in that
land: a mighty being who hates men! In old times,
many people thought that their gods were pleased when
men killed their own children and burned their bodies
on an altar as an offering to God. God saw all over the
earth that men had wrong and cruel thoughts of him;
and he sent his Son Jesus Christ to teach men by his
words, and to show men in his life what God is, how God
feels toward us, and how we should feel toward God.
If Jesus had done no more for us than to teach us the
Lord's Prayer, beginning with the words "Our Father
who art in heaven," he would have done enough to
make us love him. He showed people that God is their
Father, the Father of every one in all the world, and
that as a Father we may call upon him, just as any child
can go to his father for whatever he needs.</p>

<p>There was once an artist who was called upon to
paint the portrait of a good man. But the man had
died ten years before; the artist had never seen him, and
there was no picture of him to be used as a copy. At
first the artist did not know what to do. Then a
thought occurred to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there no one," he said, "who looks like this
man, so that I can see him and know something of the
man's face?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," they answered. "He has left a son,
a man grown, who looks exactly like his father."</p>

<p>The artist studied the face of the son, and from it
painted a likeness of the father, whom he had never
seen. No one has ever seen God, but if we would know,
not his face, which we cannot know, but his nature, how
kind, and loving, and helpful, and willing God is, we
have only to think of Christ; and if we know Christ,
the Son of God, we know God, his Father and our Father.
For this reason, because in Jesus we may know God,
everybody should know about Jesus.</p>

<p>But Jesus came to this world, not only to show us
what God is, but to show us what we should be and how
we should live. Whatever his work may be, every one
needs a copy which he can look at and follow. The child
who is learning to write must have a copy, so that he
may know how to shape his letters. The boy or girl
learning to draw has a copy or a model to guide him in
his drawing. When a man is about to build a ship, he
first makes a model and then shapes his great ship
exactly like it. Perhaps you have heard the lines in
Longfellow's poem, "The Building of the Ship."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"In the shipyard stood the Master,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the model of the vessel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That should laugh at all disaster,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And with wave and whirlwind wrestle."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Well, we are all builders. Each one of us, boy or
girl, man or woman, is building for himself what no one
else can build for him: his character, what he is to be,
whether good or bad, whether wise or ignorant, whether
noble or selfish. And in building up ourselves we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a model, one perfect man, on whom we can look and
whose life we can copy. That model we can find in
Jesus. He lived our life, and in living showed us how
we should live. Even a little child may say, "Jesus
was once a little child; and I will try my best to be just
such a child as he was." A boy of twelve may think of
Jesus as a boy and resolve to live as Jesus lived. The
young man, working in a shop, or office, or in the field,
may take Jesus the workingman for his pattern. When
Jesus was on the earth, he said many times, and to
different people, "Follow me!" He says it to every one
of us. But if we are to follow Jesus and to be like him,
the best man that ever lived, we must study him, must
know about his life, must have every story of him in our
mind and in our heart; and that is another reason why
every one should know the story of Jesus.</p>

<p>It is now almost two thousand years since Jesus
lived on the earth and walked among men. Since he
came, the world has become a different world, just as far
as they have heard the story of Jesus and have learned
to follow him. People have become less selfish and more
thoughtful of others, more willing to help others, more
generous in giving to others. Think of all the homes for
the poor, of all the hospitals for the sick, of all the places
where little children are cared for, of the playgrounds,
of the love shown at Christmas time, of ten thousand
ways in which the world is better. And then remember
that all these good things come from Jesus Christ and
his love in the hearts of men. But for Jesus, this would
have been a dark world. The proof of this is that these
good things are to be seen only in the lands where Jesus
is known and loved and followed. Look at the lands
where Christ is unknown and you find them dark and
sad. There is still much to be done to make this a
perfect world. We see terrible wars, and the poor still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
suffering wrong, and many people still selfish and cruel
to their fellow-men. What can we do to make this a
better and a brighter world? We can do as Jesus did.
It was said of him, "He went about doing good"; and
that may be said of us if we will follow Christ. But
to make this world good, we must know him who is its
power for goodness; and that is another reason why
every one should know the story of Jesus.</p>

<p>Let me name only one reason more why we should
know the story of Jesus: through him we have what we
need most of all&mdash;the forgiveness of our sins. Suppose
that someone who watches us all the time should keep
a list of every wrong-doing, of every fiery temper, of
every angry word, of every blow struck, of every time
that one of us failed to do what is right, of every time
that one let pass a chance to do some good act to another&mdash;what
a long list it would be! There is such a list kept.
An eye that never sleeps sees every act, the eye of God;
and he remembers all our deeds, and the things left
undone which we ought to have done. Is there any way
to have that list against us taken away, blotted out and
forgotten? Yes, there is one who can take our sins
away and make the black story of our life as white as
snow. That one is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He
can forgive our sins, as he forgave the sins of men while
he was on the earth; and he longs to have us ask him
for forgiveness. Should we not love him for this? And
should we not wish to hear about him and to know all the
tender story of his love?</p>

<p>These, then, are some of the reasons why we should
all seek to know the story of Jesus: because he is the
greatest and most famous man that ever lived; because
his story is full of interest and full of wonders, and is
true; because he came to show us how kind and loving
God is, and how willing to have us call upon him; because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
his life shows us a pattern of what we may be and tells
us how we may be like him; because Jesus has made and
is still making the world better, and brighter, and happier,
wherever he is known; and best of all, because through
Jesus our Saviour our sins may be forgiven and taken
away, and we may be pure and holy as Jesus was upon
the earth.</p>

<p>With these thoughts and aims, this Story of Jesus
has been written. May it help many, young and old,
to know Jesus better, to love him more, and to follow
him more closely!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Lord's Land</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 1</div>


<div class='cap'>FIRST OF ALL, let us take a journey to the land
where Jesus lived. We will sail in one of the big
ocean steamers across the Atlantic, heading our
prow a little to the south, and in eight days will pause
at the Rock of Gibraltar, which stands on guard at the
gate of the Mediterranean Sea. Do you know what "Mediterranean"
means? It means, "among the lands"; and
when you look at this sea on the map, you see that it has
lands around it on every side, with only a narrow opening at
Gibraltar, where its blue waters pour into the Atlantic Ocean.</div>

<p>We will enter the Mediterranean Sea, and sail its
entire length, past Spain and France and Italy on the
left. We just miss touching the toe of Italy, for you
know Italy runs into the sea like a great leg with a
high-heeled boot upon its foot. And just beyond Italy
we sail by Greece, which looks somewhat like a hand
with fingers wide apart.</p>

<p>While we are passing by these lands on the left,
we are also sailing past Morocco and Algiers, and Tunis
and Tripoli on the right. We stop at Alexandria in
Egypt, at one of the mouths of the river Nile, and
soon after we leave the big steamer at Port Said, where
the great Suez Canal begins.</p>

<p>There in the afternoon about ten days after our
leaving America, we go on board a smaller ship, and
sail northward past the eastern shore of the Mediterranean
Sea. The next morning we awake to find our
ship at anchor in front of a city on a hillside, rising
up in terraces from the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>That city is now called Jaffa, or Yafa; and it is
the place where the steamers stop to send ashore those
who are about to visit the Holy Land, for that is the
name given to the land where Jesus lived. Do you
remember in the Old Testament the story of Jonah, the
prophet who tried to run away from God's call to preach
in the city of Nineveh? Well, it was from this city of
Jaffa, then called Joppa, that Jonah started on his
voyage, which ended inside the big fish. Perhaps you
remember also the story of Dorcas, in the New Testament,
that good woman who helped the poor; and
after dying was raised to life through the prayer of
the Apostle Peter. Dorcas too lived at Joppa; and
they show the house where, it is said, Peter stayed while
he was visiting in that city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/illus-026-big.jpg"><img src="images/illus-026.jpg" width="300" height="140" alt="Map of Mediterranean Sea" /></a>
<span class="caption">The Mediterranean Sea</span>
</div>

<p>Here at Jaffa or Joppa we end our long sea-voyage
of about six thousand miles. We go ashore in a small
boat, tossing up and down on the waves, for there is
no wharf where a steamer can land its passengers. And
now we are standing on the soil of the Holy Land, where
Jesus lived. In Christ's time this land was called Judea.
In our day its name is Palestine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/illus-027.jpg" width="412" height="448" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">There is no real harbor at Jaffa. Steamers must anchor
some distance out, and passengers are landed
by rowboats</span>
</div>
<p>It is a small country. If you will turn to the map
of the United States, and look at New Hampshire,
you will see a state in form quite like Palestine, and
only a little smaller in size; for Palestine, or the Holy
Land, contains about twelve thousand square miles,
and New
Hampshire a
little more
than nine
thousand.</p>



<p>From
Joppa we
must go
across Palestine
if we
would look at
the part of the
land among
the mountains
where
Jesus lived.
We can now
ride in a railroad
train,
something
that Jesus
never saw
while he lived on the earth; or we can go in a carriage,
or on a horse, or on the back of a camel, as you will
see some people riding, or in what they call "a palankeen,"
which is something like a coach-body set not on
wheels, but between two pair of shafts, one in front, the
other behind, and a mule harnessed in each pair, so
that the rider has one mule in front and the other back
of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>As we ride over the land we notice that at first
it is very level. This part of the country is called "the
Sea Coast Plain," and a plain it surely is, almost as
level as a floor. All around, you see gardens and farms,
orange trees and fig trees. If you could pluck one of
these golden oranges and taste it, you would find that
it is one of the sweetest and richest and juiciest that
you have ever eaten, for the Jaffa oranges are famous
for their flavor. You ride between great fields of wheat
and rye and barley, for this Sea Coast Plain is a rich
farming land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-028.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="House" />
<span class="caption">House of Simon, the tanner, in Joppa, where Peter stayed while
visiting in that city</span>
</div>

<p>But after a few miles, ten or fifteen, we notice that
we have left the plain and are winding and climbing
among hills. In place of the farm-lands, we see here
and there flocks of sheep with shepherds guarding them
just as the boy David watched over his flock three
thousand years ago. Indeed, in our journey we might
pass over the very brook where David found the round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
smooth stones, one of which he hurled with a sling into
the giant Goliath's forehead. This is the region of low
hills, the foothills of the higher mountains beyond. It
is called "the Shephelah," a name not easy to remember.
In the Old Testament days, many battles were fought
on these hills between the Israelites and the Philistines,
their fierce enemies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/illus-029.jpg" width="295" height="285" alt="camel" />
<span class="caption">A saddled camel</span>
</div>

<p>These foothills of the Shephelah are not many
miles wide; and beyond them we come to the real
Mountain Region of Palestine. Mountains rise on
every hand, bare, stony,
with scarcely any soil upon
their steep sides, and with
not a tree to be seen for
miles. They are rocky
crags, with here and there
a village perched on their
summits or clinging to
their walls. This mountain
land, more than the
hills and plains below, was
the home of the Israelites,
the people from whom
Jesus came. We wonder
how they could ever have found a living in such a desolate
land; but everywhere we see the ruins of old cities, showing
that once the land was filled with people. In those times,
two thousand and more years ago, all these mountain-sides,
now bleak and rock-bound, were covered with
terraces, where grew olive trees, fig trees and vineyards;
where gardens blossomed and great crops were raised
to feed the people. Even now in the spring and early
summer, the valleys between these mountains are covered
with flowers of every color. Scarcely another land
on earth has as many wild flowers as this land of Palestine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
This mountain-belt, running from the north to
the south throughout the land was the part of Palestine
where nearly all the great men of Israel lived and died.
Here among the mountains in the south is Bethlehem,
where Jesus was born. In a mountain village in the
north, Nazareth, was the home of Jesus during nearly
all his life; and over these mountains everywhere in the
land, Jesus walked in the three years of his preaching
and teaching.</p>

<p>We pass over these mountains from east to west,
and then from the heights we look down to a valley
which runs north and south, the deepest in all the world,
where we can see a little river with many windings, and
rapids and falls, rolling onward to drop at last into a
blue lake in the south. This river, as you know, is
the Jordan, crossed by the Israelites when they first
came to this land; the river where Naaman washed
away his leprosy, where Elijah struck the waves with
his mantle and parted them, and in whose water Jesus
was baptized.</p>

<p>We journey across this Jordan valley, from ten to
twenty miles wide, and then we climb again high and
steep mountains. This region is called the Eastern
Table Land, because the mountains gradually sink down
to a great desert plain on the east. Here we see the
ruins of once great cities, where now only a few wandering
Arabs pitch their tents.</p>

<p>We have now crossed the land of Palestine, and
we have found that it contains five parts lying in a line:
first, the Sea Coast Plain; second, the Shephelah, or
foothills; third, the Mountain Region; fourth, the
Jordan valley; and fifth, the Eastern Table Land.</p>

<p>But we must keep in mind that the land when
Jesus lived there was very different from the land as
we see it. Now it is a poor land; then it was rich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Now its villages are made of miserable mud-houses,
where live people who look half starved; then it was
a land of well-built towns and happy people. Now we
find roads that are mere tracks over the stones; then
there were good roads everywhere. Now the hills rise
bare and rocky; then they were covered with gardens.
Now scarcely a tree can be seen in miles of travel; then
the olive and the vine and the palm grew everywhere.
We see the land in its ruin; Jesus saw it in its riches.</p>

<h2>The People in the Lord's Land</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 2</div>


<div class='cap'>NEARLY ALL the people living in Palestine in the
time of Jesus were of the Jewish race. Two
thousand years before Jesus came, a great man
was living in that land, named Abraham. To this man,
God gave a promise that his children and their children
after them for many ages should live in that land and
own it. Abraham's son was named Isaac, and Isaac's
son was named Jacob. All the people of Palestine had
sprung from the family of Jacob, and by the time Jesus
came, these descendants of Jacob, as they were called,
were in number many millions, and were to be found in
other lands besides Palestine; although more of them
lived in Palestine than in any other land.</div>

<p>Jacob, Abraham's grandson, was also named Israel;
and on that account all the people sprung from him
were called the Israelites. Jacob or Israel had twelve
sons, from whom came the twelve tribes of Israel. But
one son, named Judah, had more descendants or people
springing from him than any other; and as most of
the people in Palestine were of Judah's family, all of
them were spoken of as Jews, a word which means
sprung or descended from Judah. So the people to
whom Jesus belonged were sometimes called Israelites,
but more often Jews. They had another name,
"Hebrews," but that was not used as often as the two
names, Israelites and Jews.</p>

<p>For many years, long before Jesus came, the Jews
were rulers in the land of Palestine, with kings of their
own race, as David and Solomon in the early times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and King Jeroboam and King Hezekiah later. But in
the time of Jesus, the Jews were no longer rulers in
their own land. Palestine was then a small part of
the vast Roman Empire, which ruled all the lands around
the Mediterranean Sea. Its chief was an emperor, who
lived at Rome in Italy. At the time when Jesus was
born the emperor was Augustus. He was then an old
man, and died very soon after the birth of Jesus. The
emperor who followed him was named Tiberius, and
he ruled most of the years that Jesus was living in
Palestine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 556px;">
<img src="images/illus-033.jpg" width="556" height="387" alt="photo: Tiberias" />
<span class="caption">Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee, where Herod lived</span>
</div>

<p>But there was another king ruling the land of
Palestine under the Roman emperor, at the time when
Jesus came. His name was Herod, and because he
was a very wise and strong man, although a very wicked
man, he was called Herod the Great. He ruled the
land of Palestine, but in his turn obeyed the orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the emperor Augustus at Rome. Herod also was a
very old man at the time of Jesus' birth, and died soon
afterward.</p>

<p>When Herod the Great died, his kingdom was
divided into four parts. Each of these parts had a
king of its own, and three of these kings were Herod's
sons. Herod Antipas ruled over Galilee in the northwest,
and Perea in the southeast; Herod Philip was
over the country in the northeast; and Herod Archelaus
ruled the largest portion, in the south. None of these
little kings were good men. They had their father's
wickedness, but did not have his ability to rule. One
of them, Archelaus, was so bad that all the people asked
the emperor at Rome to take his rule away. This the
emperor did, and sent a man from Rome to govern the
land in his place. You have heard of the Roman governor
who was over this part of the land while Jesus
was teaching. His name was Pontius Pilate; and he
it was, you remember, who sent Jesus to die upon the
cross.</p>

<p>The land of Palestine at that time was divided into
five parts, which were called "provinces." The largest
of these provinces was Judea, the one on the south,
between the Dead Sea and the river Jordan on the
east, and the Mediterranean Sea on the west. North
of Judea was a small province called Samaria, where
lived a people who were not Jews but Samaritans. The
Jews hated the Samaritans, and the Samaritans, in
turn, hated the Jews. Samaria was governed as a
part of Judea, not with a separate ruler. These were
the two provinces at first under Archelaus and then
under the Roman governor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/illus-035.jpg" width="324" height="500" alt="Saul being annointed" />
<span class="caption">Samuel anointing Saul to be the first king of Israel</span>
</div>

<p>In the north of Palestine, west of the river Jordan
and the Sea of Galilee, was the province of Galilee, a
country full of mountains, where Jesus dwelt for nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
all his life. The ruler of this province was Herod
Antipas. He lived most of the time at a city which
he had built
beside the Sea
of Galilee, and
had named
Tiberias, after
the Roman
emperor Tiberius.</p>


<p>Across
the Jordan, on
the east, opposite
to Galilee
was another
province.
In the
Old Testament
times,
this land had
been called
Bashan, which
means "woodland,"
because
it was a land
of many forests.
In the
New Testament
time it
was generally
spoken of as
"Philip's province," because its ruler was Herod Philip,
the best of Herod's sons, and none too good, either.</p>

<p>South of Philip's province, and east of the river
Jordan, was a province named Perea, a word meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"beyond," because this region was beyond or across the
river Jordan. At the time of Jesus' life, Perea was
like Galilee, ruled by Herod Antipas. Once at least
Jesus visited this province;
and here he told the Parable
of the Prodigal Son,
which everybody has
heard.</p>

<p>Although the mighty
Roman empire gave to
the Jews in Palestine a
government that was just
and fair, it was not a Jewish
rule; and the Jews were
not contented under the
power of foreigners. They
felt that they more than
other nations were the
people of God, and that
they had a right to rule
themselves, under kings of
their own race. Also they
read in their Bible the
promises of the prophets
that from Israel should
come forth a king, out of
David's line, who should
rule the world.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/illus-036.jpg" width="229" height="500" alt="carved idol" />
<span class="caption">A heathen idol</span>
</div>

<p>This great King, whom
the Jews hoped for and
looked for, they called
"Messiah," a word in the Jews' language meaning the
same as the word "Christ," which is a Greek word,
meaning "the Anointed One," that is, "the King." You
remember that in the Old Testament story the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Samuel anointed Saul to be the first king of Israel, that
is, he poured oil on his head; and that afterward he
chose the boy David to be the next king by the same
sign. When we say "Jesus Christ," Jesus is his name
and "Christ" is his title; and we mean "Jesus the King."</p>

<p>We know that this promised King whom the Jews
called Messiah was Jesus Christ who rules over the
hearts of men everywhere;
but the Jews
thought that it meant
a king like Herod or
the emperor Tiberius,
only better and wiser,
who should live in a
palace at Jerusalem,
their chief city, and
make all lands obey
his will. This hope
made the Jews very
restless and unhappy
under the Roman
power. They were
always looking for the
coming of this mighty
King of the Jews, who
should lead them to
conquer the earth.</p>

<img src="images/illus-037.jpg" width="295" height="400" alt="photo synagogue" />
<span class="caption">Interior of Jewish synagogue in Palestine</span>
</div>

<p>In their worship
the Jews were different from all the rest of the world.
Every other people had gods of wood and stone, images
before which they bowed and to which they gave offerings.
In all the cities of that world were temples and
altars to these idols, made by the hands of men. But
in the land of the Jews were no images, no idol-temples,
and no offerings to man-made gods. The Jews, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in Palestine or in other lands, worshipped the One God
who was unseen, the God to whom we also pray. In
their chief city, Jerusalem, was a splendid temple where
God was worshipped; and in every Jewish city and town
were churches, where the people met to read the Bible,
to sing the psalms of David, to offer prayer to God,
and to talk together about God's laws. These churches
were called "synagogues," and wherever Jews lived,
synagogues were to be found. The Jews looked with
great contempt upon the idol-worship of other nations,
and were proud of the fact that ever since the days of
their father Abraham, they had worshipped only the
Lord God.</p>

<h2>The Stranger by the Golden Altar</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 3</div>


<div class='cap'>IN THE land of Palestine one city was loved by the
Jews above all other places. That was Jerusalem,
the largest city in the land in the province of Judea.
It was to the Jews everywhere, not only in Palestine
but over all the earth, wherever Jews lived, "the holy
city." From all parts of the land the people came at
least once in every year, and many families, three times
each year, to worship God in Jerusalem. At these great
feasts, as they were called, all the roads leading to Jerusalem
were thronged with travelers going up to Jerusalem
for worship. And the Jews in other lands, many hundreds
of miles away, even as far as Rome itself, tried
at least once in their lives to visit the city. They sang
about Jerusalem songs such as:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let my right hand forget her cunning;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If I remember thee not,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If I prefer not Jerusalem</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above my chief joy."</span><br />
</div>

<p>That which made Jerusalem a holy city was its
Temple, a magnificent building on Mount Moriah, just
across a valley from Mount Zion, where the larger part
of the city stood. The Temple they called "The House
of God," for in it the Jews believed their God made
his home. In front of this Temple stood an altar, which
was like a great box made of stone, hollow inside, and
covered with a metal grating. Upon <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'his'">this</ins> altar a fire
was kept burning night and day, and on the fire the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
priests who led in the worship of God, laid offerings of
sheep and oxen, which were burned as gifts to God;
while around the altar the people stood and prayed to
God as the offering, which they called "a sacrifice,"
was burning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-040.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Looking up the Kedron Valley toward Mt. Moriah</span>
</div>

<p>Inside the Temple building were two rooms. The
room in front was called "the holy place," and in it
stood on one side a table covered with gold, on which
lay twelve loaves of bread as an offering to God; one
loaf for each
of the twelve
tribes of Israel.
On the
other side of
the room
stood a golden
lamp-stand,
with seven
branches,
called "the
golden candlestick."
At
the farther
end of the
room stood another altar, made of gold, smaller than
the great altar in front of the Temple. On this golden
altar the priest offered twice each day a bowl of incense,
which was made by mixing some sweet-smelling gums,
frankincense and myrrh, and burning them, so that they
formed a fragrant white cloud, filling the Holy Place.</p>

<p>Beyond the Holy Place was another room called
"The Holy of Holies." Into this room no one entered
except the high priest, and he on only one day in the
year; for this inner room was set apart for the dwelling-place
of God; and the Jews believed that in this room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the light of God was shining so brightly that no one
could endure it. In the first Temple built by King
Solomon, the Ark of the Covenant stood in the Holy
of Holies. This was a chest covered with gold, within
which lay the two stone tables on which the Ten Commandments
were written. But the Ark of the Covenant
had been lost, and in the time of which we are speaking,
nothing was in the Holy of Holies except a block of
marble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-041.jpg" width="500" height="388" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">The Mosque of Omar, now on the place where the Temple once stood</span>
</div>

<p>One day an old priest named Zacharias was offering
incense upon the golden altar in the Holy Place.
He had filled the bowl, which they called a censer, with
the frankincense and myrrh, and had placed in it some
coals of fire from the great altar in front of the Temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
He had come into the Holy Place, bringing his censer of
incense, which sent its white cloud into the air, and was
just about to lay it upon the altar, when he was startled
at suddenly seeing someone standing by the golden altar
on the right side.</p>

<p>Zacharias was surprised to see anyone in the room,
for he knew that no one but himself had a right to be
there. But he was still more surprised and filled with
fear when he looked at this stranger standing by the
altar. He seemed like a young man, and his face and
body and clothes were bright and shining like the sun,
so glorious that the old priest could not bear to look
upon him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-042.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">High Priest, altar of incense, table for shew bread, and Ark of the Covenant</span>
</div>

<p>At once Zacharias knew that this glorious person
was an angel sent from God. He trembled with fear;
his knees shook, and he could scarcely keep from falling
on the floor. The angel spoke to him, gently and
kindly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Zacharias, do not be frightened. You have
nothing to fear. I have come to you with good news.
God has heard the prayers that you and your good wife
Elizabeth have been sending up to heaven for these
many years. You shall have a son, and shall call his
name John. Your son when he becomes a man will
bring joy and gladness to many people; for he shall be
great in the sight of the Lord; and it shall be his work
to make his people ready for the coming of the King
for whom
they have
been looking
so long. You
must see that
your son
never drinks
any wine or
strong drink,
for he is to be
set apart for
God, to serve
God only, and
to speak the
word of God to the people, telling them that their King
and Saviour is at hand."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-043.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="drawing priest below huge candlestick" />
<span class="caption">The golden candlestick</span>
</div>

<p>The priest was so filled with surprise and fear that
he could scarcely believe what he heard.</p>

<p>"How can these wonderful words be true?" he said.
"I am an old man, and my wife is also old. We are too
old now to have children. How can I believe all this?"</p>

<p>The angel was not pleased when he saw that Zacharias
doubted his word, and he said:</p>

<p>"I am the angel Gabriel, that stands before God;
and I have been sent from God to speak to you and
to bring you this good news. Now, because you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not believe God's word, you shall be stricken dumb,
and shall not be able to speak until my words come
true and your child is born."</p>

<p>And then the angel vanished out of sight as suddenly
as he had come, and Zacharias was left alone.</p>

<p>All this time a great crowd of people was standing
outside the Temple, worshipping God while the offering
was made. They wondered that Zacharias was
waiting so long in the Temple; and they wondered
more when he came out and they found that he could
not speak. He made signs to them, trying to show
them he had seen an angel, but he did not tell them
what the angel had said, for that was meant for himself
only and not for others.</p>

<p>Each priest stayed for one week in the Temple and
then went to his house; so after a few days Zacharias
left Jerusalem and returned to his house in the southern
part of the land, not far from the old city of Hebron,
the place where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the early
fathers of the Israelites, were buried.</p>

<p>How happy Elizabeth was when her husband, by
signs and by writing, told her of the angel and his
promise that she should be the mother of one who was
to bear the word of the Lord to the people. Such men,
to whom God spoke and who spoke for God, were called
"prophets." Many great prophets in past years had
spoken the word of God to the Israelites, men like Samuel
and Elijah and Isaiah. But more than four hundred
years had passed away since the voice of a prophet
had been heard in the land. Their promised son was
to rise up and speak once more God's will to his people.
Zacharias and Elizabeth might not live long enough to
hear his voice as a prophet, but they had God's promise,
and in that promise they were happy, waiting for their
child to come and grow up to his great work.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Angel Visits Nazareth</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 4</div>


<div class='cap'>FOR OUR next story we visit Nazareth, a village
in Galilee, nearly seventy miles north of Jerusalem.
Galilee, as we have seen, was the northern
province or division of the land, lying between the river
Jordan and the Great Sea. The lower part of Galilee
is a great plain, called "the plain of Esdraelon," or "the
plain of Jezreel," where many battles have been fought
in past times. The upper part of Galilee is everywhere
mountains and valleys, with villages perched on the
mountain tops or clinging to their sides, and sometimes
nestled in the valleys. Just where the plain ends and
the mountains begin, we find a long range of steep hills.
If we climb to the top of this range, on one side we
see the plain stretched out, and far in the distance the
Mediterranean Sea; and on the other, or northern slope
of the hills, we come to the city of Nazareth. There
the mother of Jesus lived as a young girl before her
son was born, and there Jesus lived during most of
his life.</div>

<p>Nazareth is there still, although many of the old
towns in that land have passed away; and now it is
quite a city, but in the time of which we are telling
it was only a village. All around it are hills. One
can stand in the town and count fifteen hills and mountains,
all in sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-046.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Nazareth from the road to Cana</span>
</div>

<p>Its narrow streets climb the hills between rows of
one-story white houses, many of them having a little
dome on the roof. Around each roof in those times of
which we are telling was a rail with posts on the corners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to prevent any one on the roof from falling off, for the
flat roof was used as a place of visiting and of rest, since
the house inside was dark, having no glass windows, but
instead only one small hole in the wall. None of these
houses had a door opening upon the street. Beside
the road was a high wall, and in it a gate leading to
an open court, at one end of which stood the house.</p>

<p>In the village was one fountain, to which all the
women went for water. There were no wells or pumps
or pipes with water in the houses; and around the fountain
might be seen in the morning a crowd of women
bringing water-jars empty, and carrying them home full
of water, balanced on their heads. No one often saw
a man carrying a jar of water, for this was looked upon
as a woman's work.</p>

<p>In one of those small white houses of Nazareth
lived a young Jewish girl named Mary. We do not
know how she looked, for although many artists have
made pictures of her, all have drawn or painted her
as they imagined her to be, not as she was. All that
we really know of Mary, we read in two of the four
gospels, Matthew and Luke; and neither of these tell
us anything about her early life or her family. It has
been said that her father's name was Joachim and her
mother's was Anna; but this is not found in either of
the gospels, and we do not know whether it is true.</p>

<p>We do know, however, that she was a pure-hearted,
lovely girl, who served the God of Israel with all her
heart and lived a holy life. She knew her Bible well,
we are sure, for its words came readily to her lips; and
she was a girl who thought much and talked but little.
In those years she might have been seen often going
with the other girls of the village to the fountain for
water, or sitting in the women's gallery in the church,
listening thoughtfully to the reading from the Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and with her rich young voice joining in the chanting
of David's psalms.</p>

<p>In that land girls are promised in marriage while
very young, and Mary was at this time promised to
be married to a man named Joseph, who was a carpenter,
or, as he is called in the gospels, a worker in
wood. The two families, Joseph's and Mary's, were
not rich. They belonged to the working class of people,
but they were not like many, wretchedly poor. They
were just plain, honest, working people, able to earn a
comfortable living.</p>

<span class="caption">Mary beheld the angel Gabriel suddenly beaming upon her.</span>
</div>

<p>Although Joseph and Mary were of the common
people, they came from the noblest blood in all the
land. Both were sprung from the royal line of David,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the greatest of the kings of Israel, and the singer of
many beautiful psalms. They lived in little one-room
houses, and their hands were hard from work, but they
could trace their line back to the palace where David
the founder of their family dwelt.</p>

<p>On one day Mary was alone. It may have been
in her own little home, or upon its roof, where she
often went for prayer, or perhaps under a tree on the
hillside near the village. Just as Zacharias a few months
before had seen a heavenly, gloriously-shining being in
the Temple, so now Mary beheld the same angel Gabriel
suddenly beaming upon her. In a sweet voice he said:</p>

<p>"Peace be with you, Mary! You are in high favor
and love, for the Lord is with you!"</p>

<p>The voice was gentle, but the sight of this shining
form filled the young girl with alarm. She knew not
what to think, nor why this glorious being had come
to her. But after a moment the angel went on speaking,
and said:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, Mary, for God has chosen you
among all women for his special favor. You shall have
a son; and you shall give him the name Jesus, because
he shall save his people from their sins. He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest God.
God shall give to him the throne and the kingdom of
his father David. He shall reign forever over the people
of Israel, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."</p>

<p>The angel paused and Mary found words to speak,
tremblingly and with fear:</p>

<p>"How can all this come to me? I do not understand
what it all means!"</p>

<p>Then the angel spoke again to the troubled and
frightened girl:</p>

<p>"The Holy Spirit of God shall come to you, and
the power of God shall be upon you; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that holy child that is to be given you shall be called
'The Son of God.' Also, let me tell you that your
cousin Elizabeth is soon to have a son in her old age.
This may seem strange to you; but no word of God is
without power. Every promise of God shall surely
come to pass."</p>

<p>Then Mary said:</p>

<p>"I am the Lord's servant, and I can trust him.
Let it be to me as you have spoken. I will rest without
fear in the will of the Lord."</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as he had come, the angel vanished
out of sight, and Mary was left alone. She was
filled with wonder at what she had seen and heard.
Any young Jewish girl to whom came the news that
the words of the prophets in the Bible were now to
come true, that the long-promised King of Israel was
soon to be born, and that she should be his mother,
would be amazed and perhaps alarmed at the message.</p>

<p>Some girls would have talked about it, and might
even be proud at such an expectation. But Mary's
was a quiet nature, not apt to speak of her deepest
thoughts. She felt in some way that there was no one
in her home or in her village with whom she could speak
of these things. She hid them silently in her heart,
but thought about them day and night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Young Girl's Journey</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 5</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE visit of the angel and the message
which he had brought, Mary's mind was filled
with many thoughts and her heart was full. She
was only a young girl, not older than sixteen years,
perhaps as young as fifteen; for if she were older she
should have been already married. In that land nearly
all young women are married as soon as they are sixteen
years old; and very few stay unmarried.</div>

<p>Mary felt that she must talk with somebody of all
these wonderful things that had been spoken to her.
We would think that her mother was the one with whom
she could open her heart most freely, but we are not
sure that her mother was living. And is it not true
that a young girl can sometimes tell to a dear grandmother,
or some other old lady who is her friend, the
deep things of the heart that she may hesitate to mention
even to her own mother?</p>

<p>She thought of one who was not her grandmother,
but who from her age and sweetness seemed like one.
Her mind turned to Elizabeth, living far away in the
south. The angel, you know, had told her that Elizabeth
was also to have a child, and perhaps she would
be able to understand Mary's feelings better than any
other woman.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was related to Mary. She is named in
the gospel of St. Luke as Mary's cousin, though very
likely they were not near, but distant relatives. Mary
knew that she was wise and good, that she loved her,
and being old, could give her advice. Mary made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
her mind to visit Elizabeth and open her heart with
her fully about what the angel had spoken to her.
From Nazareth to Elizabeth's house was a long distance,
in a straight line more than eighty miles, but
much farther by the road which travelers from Galilee
generally followed in going from the north to the south
of the land.</p>

<p>Very soon after the angel's visit, Mary left her
home and began her journey southward. Of course,
a young girl could not take a journey so long alone.
But there were always caravans or parties going from
Galilee to Jerusalem, and Mary would travel with one
of those companies. A soldier would ride on a horse,
a general in his chariot, and an Arab on his camel; but
most men in those times walked, even on long journeys.
A woman would ride on an ass, which was the animal
preferred by the Jews for travel.</p>

<p>We may think of Mary with a beating heart leaving
her home in Nazareth in company with a caravan
or party of people journeying to Jerusalem to attend
one of the great feasts held every year in that city.
Their most direct way would be over the mountains;
but it would be rough and stony; up one mountain,
down another, and around a third mountain, nearly
all the way. Besides, this way would lead them through
the country of the Samaritans, which lay between Galilee
and Judea, and such was the hatred between Jews and
Samaritans that it was scarcely safe for a company of
Jews to go through their land. A large company would
need to stop by night at some inn, and the Samaritans
often shut their inns against those who were going to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The line of travel from Nazareth would be to go
over the steep hill on the south of their village, then
follow a well-trodden way eastward down to the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Jordan. There they would find a very good road built
by the Romans, straight down the Jordan Valley, with
mountains on either side. This they would follow about
sixty miles until they came to Jericho. There they
might rest for a few days; and then climb the steep
path up the mountains to Jerusalem. This Jericho
road was a hiding place for robbers, and it was never
safe for anyone to travel it alone. But in a large company,
with many men, and often a guard of soldiers,
the travelers need not fear. They would easily reach
Jerusalem in a week or ten days after leaving Nazareth,
and might make the journey in five days if they were
in haste.</p>

<p>In Jerusalem Mary would visit with some friend.
All the families in the land had friends in Jerusalem
with whom they stayed while attending the great feasts,
of which three were held each year; and the dwellers
in Jerusalem opened their houses to the same families
year after year. After the feast, Mary would find
another caravan or party going home to Hebron and
the villages near it, and she would travel the rest of
her journey, about twenty miles, with this party. Altogether,
Mary's journey, from Nazareth to Hebron, was
nearly one hundred and twenty miles long. Although
many people were with her all the way, she was alone
in spirit, for she could speak to no one of the great
thoughts which burdened her mind and her heart.</p>

<p>At last her long journey was over. She stopped
at the door of the house of Zacharias; and in a moment
was clasped in the arms of Elizabeth. In some strange
way God had given to Elizabeth to know all that had
come to Mary. In a loud voice she said:</p>

<p>"Blessed, most blessed are you among women!
And blessed among men shall be the son born to you!
High indeed is the honor mine today when the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of my Lord comes to my home! Blessed is she that
believed the angel's word, for that word shall surely
come true!"</p>

<p>In that moment Mary's feelings, long held in,
broke out into song. For this young woman's soul
was not only pure and tender and devout, it was the
soul of a poet whose thoughts shape themselves into
verse. Mary spoke and sung a song which has become
famous. Someone wrote it down, and Saint Luke, who
wrote the gospel, found a copy of it and gave it to the
world. Everyone should read it. We give it here.</p>


<div class='center'>MARY'S SONG</div>

<div class='poem'>
My soul beholds the greatness of the Lord,<br />
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<br />
For he hath looked upon his servant in my lowly state;<br />
And from this time people in all ages shall call me blessed.<br />
<br />
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;<br />
And holy is his name.<br />
And his mercy is from age to age<br />
On those who fear him.<br />
<br />
He hath showed strength with his arm;<br />
He hath scattered the proud in the vain thoughts of their heart.<br />
He hath put down princes from their thrones,<br />
And hath lifted up those of humble state.<br />
<br />
The hungry he hath filled with good things;<br />
And the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
He hath given help to Israel his servant<br />
That he might remember mercy<br />
As he spoke to our fathers,<br />
Toward Abraham and his children forever.<br />
</div>

<p>For three months Mary stayed with Elizabeth in
that quiet home, the old woman and the young woman,
both soon to be mothers, talked together day after day.
Perhaps by this time people were going to another feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in Jerusalem, and Mary found again a party of pilgrims&mdash;for
that was the name that they gave to people going
to Jerusalem to worship&mdash;who were returning to Galilee.
She went home, comforted in spirit and made strong
by her visit with Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It was either while Mary was visiting with Elizabeth,
or soon after her return to her home, that Joseph,
her promised husband, began to question in his mind
whether he ought to marry her. There was a strange
look in her face, and he saw that she had thoughts in
her mind of which she could not speak to him. He
loved her deeply, and it was with sorrow that he asked
himself whether they would be happy together.</p>

<p>But one night, while he was sleeping, a dream came
to Joseph. In his dream he saw an angel standing by
his side. The angel said to him:</p>

<p>"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take
Mary for your wife. She shall have a son; and his
name shall be Jesus, for it is he that shall save his
people from their sins."</p>

<p>The word Jesus, in the language of that people,
means "Saviour," and often Jesus is spoken of as "Our
Saviour" because he came to take away our sins.</p>

<p>After this message, Joseph hesitated no longer. He
did as the angel had bidden him. He was married to
Mary, and led her to his own home, in which was also
the shop where he followed his trade as a carpenter.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Boy Who Never Tasted Wine</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 6</div>


<div class='cap'>NOT LONG after Mary's visit, the child promised
to Zacharias and Elizabeth was born. In Jewish
families the coming of a child into the home
was always the cause of great gladness; and the gladness
was greater at the birth of this baby, because this
was the first child, and the father and mother were old.
All the friends of Zacharias and Elizabeth came to see
them and to rejoice with them over the boy whom God
had given them.</div>

<p>"He must be named Zacharias after his father,"
said the visitors.</p>

<p>"Not so," answered the mother; "he shall be
named John."</p>

<p>"Why should you give him that name?" they said.
"None of your family has ever been called John."</p>

<p>But Elizabeth insisted that her boy should bear
the name John.</p>

<p>You remember that Zacharias had been stricken
dumb at the time when the angel spoke to him in the
Temple. In all the months since he had not spoken a
word. Nor could he hear what was said; for now they
made signs, to ask him what should be the child's name.
They brought him a writing table, and on it he wrote,
"His name is John." So that was the name of this
child of promise, just as the angel Gabriel had said.</p>

<p>You may ask, what was a writing table? In those
times paper was very scarce and high in its cost. It
was used only for writing down matters that were important.
For common uses, each family had a writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
table, which was a board over which was spread a thin
layer of wax. On this wax they marked what they
wished to write, with a sharp-pointed pen of iron or
steel. This kind of a pen was called a stylus. The
other end of the pen was flat, like an ivory paper-cutter.
After writing, they could smooth it all out
again; and the wax was then ready to be used once
more.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Zacharias had written the words
"His name is John," the power to hear and to speak
came back to him. He began to praise God in a loud
voice, and gave forth a song of rejoicing. This song
was afterward written, and may be read in the gospel
by St. Luke, near the end of
the first chapter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/illus-059.png" width="372" height="300" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Writing tablets</span>
</div>

<p>In this song, Zacharias
gave thanks to God for having
blessed his people and kept
the promises that had been
made in God's name by all
the prophets of old time. The
prophets, as you may know,
were the good men who listened
to God's words and then gave them to the people,
speaking with God's power; and sometimes telling, long
before the time, of great events that were to take place.
They were men like Moses, who saw God face to face,
and Samuel the wise ruler, and Elijah the prophet of
fire, and Isaiah, who declared Christ's coming long before
his day. In the Old Testament times there was always
a prophet to tell the people the will of God. But since
the Old Testament had been finished, almost five hundred
years before this time, no prophet had stood up in Israel
with the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>Zacharias knew that this newly-born child should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
grow up to give God's message to the people. He said
in his song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And you, O child, shall be called the prophet of God;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For you shall go before the Lord Christ, to make ready a way for him;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You shall give to his people the good news of a Saviour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the forgiveness of their sins</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Because of the tender mercy of God."</span><br />
<br /></div>

<span class="caption">John the Baptist in the desert</span>
</div>

<p>In the home of Zacharias and Elizabeth the baby
John grew up a strong, noble boy. Very early they
told him of the angel's visit, and of the command that
throughout his life he was not to taste wine nor any
strong drink. He was under a vow or pledge of special
service for God; and one sign of his pledge was to be
his not tasting wine nor even eating grapes. Another
sign was in leaving his hair to grow long and never
cutting it. Everyone who saw him would know by
these signs that he was pledged to a life of peculiar
service to God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When John became a young man he went away
from his home and lived in the desert, alone with his
own thoughts and with God. Very likely, his father
and mother died before he went to live alone, for at
the time of his birth they were old people and could
not live many years.</p>

<p>John lived upon the plainest of food, the locusts
that could be gathered in the field, and were boiled,
to be eaten by the poorest people. He ate also the
honey made by the wild bees and stored by them in
hollow trees and holes in the rocks. All those years
of his young manhood, John was thinking upon the
work to which God had called him, talking with God
and learning God's will; so that when the time came,
he could give God's message to the people.</p>

<h2>The Child-King in His Cradle</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 7</div>


<div class='cap'>FOR A FEW months after their marriage, Joseph
and Mary lived in their little house at Nazareth.
Joseph worked at his trade as a carpenter, while
Mary cared for the home and carried the water for the
needs of the house from the well in the middle of the
village, walking with her jar full of water on her head.</div>

<p>One day Joseph came home and told his wife that
he had been called to go on a journey to Bethlehem,
which was the town from which their family had come.
Both Joseph and Mary, as we have seen, had sprung
from the line of the great King David, who had been
born in Bethlehem more than a thousand years before.
Every one who belonged to the line of David, wherever
he might be living, looked upon Bethlehem as the home-town
of his family.</p>

<p>The Emperor Augustus at Rome, who ruled over
all the lands and was above Herod, the king of Judea,
had given orders that a list should be made of all the
families in his wide empire. He wished to lay a tax
upon every family; that is, to call upon every family
to pay money for the support of his officers, his army,
his court; and in order to fix this tax, he must have
written down the names of all the people.</p>

<p>In our land such a list is made every ten years,
and is called a census. With us, men are chosen in
every city and town to go to the people where they live
and make the list of their names. From all the states
throughout the land, these lists are sent to one office,
and there the names are arranged in order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-064.jpg" width="500" height="365" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, said to enclose the birthplace

<span class="caption">The shepherds came to the stable, opened the door and found just what the
angel said they would see, a tiny babe lying in the manger.</span>
</div>

<p>But the Romans who were ruling the world at
that time chose a plan for making this great list which
would give themselves the least trouble, even though
it gave to the people under them much more trouble,
and compelled them to make long journeys. Instead
of appointing in each place an officer to take the names
of the people at the places where they were living, they
made a law that every family must go to the city or
town from which they or their fathers had come, and
there give their names to the officers who were making
the roll of the people. Those who were living in Jerusalem,
and had come from Shechem or Joppa or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Caesarea'">Cæsarea</ins>,
must journey to one of these places and there make
their report; those who were living in Nazareth and
had come, or their parents before them had come, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
any other place, must go to their home-town, however
far it might be, and in that place be enrolled or written
upon the list of names.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that Mary, although
herself sprung from the family of David, was compelled
to make this journey to Bethlehem with her husband.
The Roman laws took very little notice of women,
unless they were rich women who could be taxed.
Joseph could go alone to Bethlehem, and there have
both their names written upon the list. But at once
a thought came to Mary, and she said to her husband:</p>

<p>"You shall not make the journey to Bethlehem
alone. I will go with you."</p>

<p>We are not told why the young wife was resolved
to go with her husband on the long journey, but the
reason may have been this: Mary knew that she was
to have a son, and the time for his coming was now
near at hand. She knew, too, that her child should be
the Son of David and the King of Israel, that he was
to sit on David's throne. She wished him to be born,
not in the village of Nazareth in Galilee, but in David's
own town of Bethlehem. He was to spring from the
royal line, and she was willing to endure a hard, trying
journey, and even to suffer, that her son might come
from the royal city where David lived. Mary had
read the books of the Old Testament, and she knew
that in those books it had been written by the prophets,
to whom God had spoken, that this king, whom they
called Messiah and Christ, should be born in Bethlehem.
These were the reasons that made Mary decide so quickly
to go with her husband on his journey to Bethlehem,
the city of their fathers.</p>

<p>So Joseph locked up his carpenter's shop and set
his wife upon an ass, and with a staff walked beside her,
over the mountain and down the valley to the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Jordan, and thence following the river, over the Roman
road, the same long road that Mary had taken in the
caravan or company of pilgrims some months before.
Joseph had been over that road many times, going up
every year to the feasts at Jerusalem, so that he knew
all the places which they passed, and could tell Mary
stories of their people and the great events which had
taken place on the mountains or in the cities as they
came into view in their journey.</p>

<p>They stopped at Jericho, near the head of the Dead
Sea, and there turned westward, climbing the mountains
over the robber-haunted road, and reaching Jerusalem.
Perhaps they rested a day or two in this city
and then went over to the mount of Olives, past the
village of Bethany; and six miles south of Jerusalem
they entered the gate of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>They had no friends with whom they could stay
in Bethlehem, and so they sought out the inn, or the
khan, as it was called. This was a large building with
rooms around an open court. In this court the animals
and the baggage were placed, and the guests of the inn
were in the rooms around it. But Joseph and Mary
were not the only people who had come to Bethlehem
to have their names enrolled or written upon the lists
for the taxing. Others had reached the inn or khan
before them. When they came the courtyard was filled
with asses and camels and chariots and baggage, and
all the rooms around the court were crowded with
visitors. Joseph found within the walls of the khan
no place where his wife could rest after her long and
wearisome ride.</p>

<p>But at last Joseph learned of a place where they
might stay through the night and for a few days. It
was only a cave, hollowed out in the hillside, used as a
stable for cattle; but miserable as it was, Mary was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
glad to lie down upon the straw and rest. And in that
cave-stable Mary's child was born. She wrapped her
little baby in such clothes as she could find at hand,
and laid him for his first sleep in the manger where the
oxen had fed. This was the lowly cradle of the Son of
David, the King
who was to rule
over all the earth!
King Herod in his
palace did not
know, and the
Emperor Augustus
at Rome did
not dream, that
in the humble
stable at Bethlehem
was lying a
Prince who should
reign over a realm
vastly greater
than Judea or the
Roman Empire;
that all the world
should date their
years from the
year when that
baby was born;
and that his name
would be praised long after their names had been
forgotten.</p>

<span class="caption">Main street in Bethlehem</span>
</div>

<p>But although neither King Herod, nor the Emperor
Augustus, nor the high-priest and rulers in Jerusalem
were there to welcome their new-born King, there were
some visitors at his manger-cradle. In the open fields
around Bethlehem were shepherds, watching at night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
over their flocks of sheep, just as, a thousand years
before in the same fields, the young shepherd David
had cared for his sheep, guarding them from wild beasts
of the wilderness and from robbers.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great, dazzling light flashed upon these
shepherds, and they saw, as Zacharias had seen by the
altar, and as Mary had seen in Nazareth, a glorious
angel standing before them. The shepherds were filled
with fear and fell upon their faces on the ground, not
daring to look up at the shining form. But the angel
spoke to them kindly and graciously, saying:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, for I come with good news,
which will make you glad; news for all God's people.
On this very night is born in yonder city of David,
one who shall be the Saviour, even Christ your Lord
and King. Would you wish to go and see this child?
I will tell you how you can find him. Look for a newly-born
baby wrapped in such clothes as babies wear, and
lying, not in a cradle in a house, but in the manger of
a stable, where the oxen and the asses are kept. There
you will find the child who is to be the King of all the
earth!"</p>

<p>While shepherds were listening to the words of
this angel, they saw that the entire midnight sky over
them was filled with a multitude of heavenly beings.
The shepherds heard them sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Glory to God in the highest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And on earth peace among men in whom God is well pleased."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then the vision faded away, the angelic host passed
out of sight, and in the dark sky only the stars were
shining above them. Then the shepherds said to each
other:</p>

<p>"Let us leave our sheep here for a little while, and
go to the village and see this wonderful thing that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
come to pass. How good it is that the Lord has given
this word to us, that we may be the first to look upon
our King!"</p>

<p>It did not take the shepherds a long time to find
the right stable and the manger, for Bethlehem was
then only a small village. They came, opened the door,
and found just what the angel had said they would
see, a tiny baby lying in the manger, his mother hovering
near, and Joseph watching over them both in
tenderness.</p>

<p>They saw the royal little one, and bowed low around
his manger cradle, then went again to their flocks in
the field, praising God for his goodness in sending the
long-promised King. The people to whom the shepherds
told this story, wondered at it, hardly knowing
whether to believe it or not; for this was not the way
in which they looked for the King of Israel to come.
They were expecting a prince to be born in a palace,
not a working-woman's child in a dark cave where
cattle were kept.</p>

<p>But Mary, happy with her little one, clasped him
to her heart and said nothing to anyone of the angel
that had come to her in Nazareth, and of the promises
given her about this child. When the day came to
name the child, she simply said, "His name shall be
Jesus," but she told no one why the name was given.
It was a common name among the Jews, so no one
was surprised at the name. But no word could tell
better than his name "Jesus" what this child should
become, for the word Jesus means "Saviour."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Baby Brought to the Temple</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 8</div>


<div class='cap'>ALTHOUGH JESUS was born in a stable and slept
in a manger, he did not stay in that place long.
After a few days Joseph was able to find a more
comfortable home, where the young mother and her
baby were taken. The Jews were very kind to strangers
of their own people, and welcomed them to their houses
when passing through their towns.</div>

<p>Joseph and his family were in Bethlehem for some
weeks, perhaps for some months. It may have been
their purpose to make Bethlehem their home, and to
bring up this child, the Son of David, in David's own
city, where he could have a better training for his coming
life, whatever that life might be, than in the country
village of Nazareth.</p>

<p>On the day when Jesus was forty days old, he was
brought with his mother to Jerusalem, which was only
six miles from Bethlehem. There he was taken to the
Temple for a service which showed that he was given to
God and to be brought up as God's child. It was the
rule of the Jews that after the first child had come to a
family, an offering should be made on the altar in the
Temple for him and prayers should be said. A family
that was rich would offer for their first child a sheep,
which was killed and burned on the altar as a gift to
God in place of the child. If the family was poor, or of
the working class of people, the parents offered a pair
of doves or pigeons. Joseph and Mary brought a pair
of doves, and stood by while these were burned on the
altar, Mary holding her baby in her arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment there was in the Temple an old
man named Simeon. He was a good man and very
earnest in his prayers to God that he might live to see
the Messiah-King of
Israel, the Christ of God,
who had been promised
through the prophets of
old. And God had said
to Simeon that he should
not die until he had seen
Christ. On that morning
a voice had seemed
to say to him, "Go to
the Temple." He obeyed
it, not knowing why he
had been sent to that
place on that day.</p>

<p>As Joseph and Mary
brought the baby Jesus
into the Temple, the voice
of the Lord spoke again to
Simeon, saying:</p>

<p>"This child is David's
Son, the King of
Israel."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/illus-074.jpg" width="307" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Mary and the doves</span>
</div>

<p>The old man came forward, held out his arms, and
took the child into them, folded him to his bosom, and
lifting up his eyes to heaven, said in Hebrew verse:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Now, Lord, thou mayest let thy servant go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">According to thy word, in peace.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For these eyes of mine have seen thy Saviour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whom thou hast sent to all the people.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A light to shine upon the nations,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the glory of thine own people Israel."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Joseph and Mary were filled with wonder at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
act and words of the old man, whom they had never
seen before and did not know. But as he placed the
child in their arms again, he prayed for God's blessing
upon both Joseph and Mary.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "this child will become a cause
for many to fall and to rise again in Israel. He shall be
God's sign of mercy, but many shall speak against him.
Also, sorrow like a sword shall pierce through your soul,
O mother; and the thoughts out of many hearts shall be
made known."</p>

<p>Those words seemed very strange at the time; but
long afterward, when Jesus had grown to be a man,
Mary found how true they were, as she saw enemies
gathered against her son, and at last looked at him
dying upon the cross. Then, indeed, a sword went
through Mary's soul.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a woman came up to the little
group. She was very old, more than ninety years of
age; and being a widow and a devout worshipper of
God she stayed nearly all her days in the Temple praying.
God had spoken to her also with the promise of a
coming Christ, the Saviour and King. She too saw in
this little baby the promised Messiah, and in a loud
voice gave thanks and praise to God. All who heard
her wondered at her words, and wondered all the more
as they looked on this plainly-clad father and mother
with their baby, all evidently from the country, and
the speech of Joseph and Mary showing they had come
from Galilee in the far north.</p>

<p>Thus even while Jesus was a very young baby, only
forty days old, here in Jerusalem a few people had looked
upon him and spoken of him as the coming King of Israel.</p>

<p>Joseph and Mary carried the child back to their new
home in Bethlehem; and Mary had more thoughts to hide
within her silent heart long after that day in the Temple.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Followers of the Star</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 9</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JOSEPH and Mary with the child Jesus
were still staying in Bethlehem, the city of
Jerusalem was stirred by the coming of some
men from a land far away, with a strange question.
These men were not Jews, but were Gentiles, which was
the name that the Jews gave to all people except themselves.
All Romans and Greeks and Egyptians and all
others who were not of their own race, the Jews called
by the name "Gentiles." These Gentile strangers who
came to Jerusalem were asking of everybody whom they
met this question:</div>

<p>"Can you tell us where is to be found the little child
who is born to be the King of the Jews? We have
seen his star in the east, and we have come to do him
honor?"</p>

<p>Who were these men, and what was the star that
they had seen?</p>

<p>We are not certain as to their land, but it is generally
thought to have been the country now called
Persia, then known as Parthia, a land about a thousand
miles to the east of Judea. Although some Jews lived
in that land&mdash;for Jews were to be found then as now in
all lands, especially in large cities&mdash;the people of Parthia
were not Jews, but, as the Jews called them, Gentiles.
Although not of the Jewish race, these people were like
the Jews in one respect&mdash;they never bowed down to
worship images which men had made. They worshipped
the One God of all the earth; and they prayed with their
faces toward the sun. They said that they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
worship the sun, but the One God who was like the sun,
the light of the world.</p>

<p>Among these Parthian people were many men who
at night studied the stars in the sky. They did not have
telescopes, as those who look at the stars now have, to
bring the heavenly bodies, the moon, the planets, and
the stars nearer to them; they could only use their own
eyes, but by long study they had learned much about
the stars, could tell of their movements and where in
the sky to find each one of them. The men who gave
their lives to this study of the stars were called Magi,
a word meaning "Wise Men"; and these strangers who
were seeking the child-king in Jerusalem are sometimes
spoken of as "the Wise Men," sometimes as "the Magi."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-077.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The Wise Men on their journey</span>
</div>

<p>The people of that time believed that when great
kings were born, or before they died, strange stars suddenly
appeared in the heavens, shone for a time and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as suddenly passed out of sight. A year or perhaps two
years before Jesus was born in Bethlehem, such a star,
very bright, that had never before been seen, began to
shine. In some way it came to the minds of these men
that this star pointed to the coming of a great king who
was to rule over all the lands, and who was to be found
in the land of Judea.</p>

<p>These Wise Men at once made up their minds to go
to the land of Judea and see this child-king. It was a
long and hard journey of more than a thousand miles.
They must pass from the high plains of Parthia down to
the lowlands of Babylonia, must find some way to cross
two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Then
they would come to a vast trackless desert, where nothing
grew and there was no water. If they went around this
desert they must follow up the Euphrates River far to
the north, and then traveling southward under the
shadow of lofty mountains, they would come at last to
Judea, and to Jerusalem, its largest city. Through all
that long and trying journey, which would last a year,
traveling most of the way on camels, they saw the wonderful
star in the sky seeming to lead the way.</p>

<p>From the story as told in the Gospel by St. Matthew
it appears that when these men came to Jerusalem the
star was no longer shining. However, the loss of the
star would not matter so much, now that they were in
the King's own land, for they supposed that everybody
in that country, and especially in the city of Jerusalem,
would know that their Prince was born. But to their
surprise, nobody seemed to have heard about the newly-born
King. They did not meet the shepherds of Bethlehem,
who had seen the angel on the night of Jesus'
birth, nor did they hear of old Simeon and Anna who a
month or more before had seen the Christ-child. Very,
very few were those who knew that the King had come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and none of these few people did these strangers chance
to meet.</p>

<p>They thought that at one place they could surely
learn where to look for this young Prince. That was the
king's palace in Jerusalem. Herod was still living,
although old and very feeble, yet as fierce and cruel as
ever. Perhaps they thought that this Prince for whom
they were looking might be a son or a grandson of the
king. Herod did not live in Jerusalem, for he did not
like its people and he knew how greatly its people hated
him; but he had a palace in the city and he came to it
often for short visits. He may have been in Jerusalem
when the Wise Men came; or they may have sought
Herod down at Jericho, twenty miles away, where
most of the time he lived.</p>

<p>As soon as the old king heard the question of these
strangers, and learned that they had been led by a star
to his land, he was filled with alarm. A child born to be
king of the Jews&mdash;if there was such a child, what would
become of Herod's own throne and crown? If he could
find where this child was, he would send his soldiers to
the place and soon kill him, as he had killed many others
whom he suspected of seeking to take away his kingdom.
But Herod hid his cruel purpose, and spoke kindly to
these strangers about their errand. He asked them when
the star appeared, how it looked, and how they knew that
it showed that a king had been born.</p>

<p>Then Herod sent for the wisest men in his land, the
teachers of the law who lived in Jerusalem. He knew
that all the people were looking for the coming of their
Messiah-king, whom they also called the Christ.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," asked Herod, "in what place
this great King, the Messiah or Christ, is to be born?"</p>

<p>The scholars were ready with their answer. They
said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"In Bethlehem of Judea, the city of David, this
King who springs from David's line shall be born. This
is what the old prophets have said."</p>

<p>And they read to him one of the promises of the
prophets that the King should come out of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Then Herod sent again for the Wise Men, and asked
them to give him the exact time when they first saw the
star. When he had learned the time, he thought at
once that this long-looked-for King must have been born
in Bethlehem less than two years before.</p>

<p>"Go to Bethlehem," said Herod to the Wise Men,
"and search through the town until you find this child;
and when you have found him, come and tell me, for I
wish to do honor to this King."</p>

<p>That was what Herod said; but what he meant to
do was a very different thing, as we shall see.</p>

<p>The Wise Men at once started for Bethlehem, which
was only six miles from Jerusalem. They went over
one of the mountains, and then one said to another:</p>

<p>"Look, there is the star once more! See it in the
sky just before us!"</p>

<p>The star stood over the road leading to Bethlehem,
and again they followed it rejoicing. It led them straight
to the city, and then to a house, over which it seemed to
pause. They knocked at the door, and when it was
opened they went into a room, where they found a baby
lying in its young mother's arms.</p>

<p>These Wise Men knew at once that here was the
King for whom they had sought so long and traveled so
far. They bowed before him to the ground to show the
high honor in which they held him. Then they opened
the treasures which they had brought from their own
land, and gave to him rich gifts, such as were presented
to kings. They gave him gold, and frankincense and
myrrh, the fragrant gums that were used in offerings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were very costly. Thus, while in his own land only a
few people showed their gladness at the coming of their
king, the strangers from a distant country came to pay
him honor. We would have thought that some of the
learned Jews, who could tell King Herod where the King
was born, might have come with the Wise Men to see
him. But these great scholars really cared very little
about Jesus. They stayed at home and soon forgot the
men of the east, their journey, and their question.</p>

<h2>Safe in Egypt</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 10</div>


<div class='cap'>ON THE night after their visit to Mary and her
child, the Wise Men had a dream. In their
dream they heard the voice of God saying to them:</div>

<p>"Do not go to meet King Herod again. He is no
friend to this princely child. Return to your own land
by some other way, and do not let Herod know it."</p>

<p>The Wise Men obeyed the voice of the Lord. They
left Bethlehem very quietly, telling no one the road that
they were taking; and without going through Herod's
city, went back to their own land, far-distant Parthia.</p>

<p>As soon as the Wise Men had left, on that night
Joseph also had a dream. He saw an angel by his bed,
who said to Joseph:</p>

<p>"Rise up at once; take the little child and his
mother, and go as quickly as you can down to the land
of Egypt, stay in that country until I tell you to leave
it, for very soon King Herod will try to kill this child."</p>

<p>Without waiting a moment, Joseph awaked Mary
from her sleep, and in the night they left the house,
taking the sleeping baby with them. They passed
silently through the dark streets of Bethlehem and found
the road that would lead them to Egypt. At times
Mary rode upon an ass, holding her precious child; at
others she walked while Joseph guided the animal which
carried their possessions. It was a journey of more than
a hundred miles to Egypt, but they went in safety, unknown
to King Herod.</p>

<p>In Egypt they could dwell safely, for that land
was not a part of Herod's kingdom. Many Jews were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
dwelling there, and among them Joseph could live by
his trade, for he was a skilful worker in wood. How long
they stayed in Egypt we do not know. It may have been
either a few months or a few years.</p>

<p>Herod waited for some time to see the Wise Men
again, and to find where the child-king was living. But
as the days passed and he heard nothing from them, and
finally learned that they had left for their home-land
without obeying his command to come and see him, he
was very angry. But he was resolved to kill this child,
who if he should live might take the kingdom from him
or from his family.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-084.jpg" width="500" height="429" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Joseph and Mary with Jesus in Egypt</span>
</div>

<p>Herod planned and carried out a fearfully wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
deed, but not more wicked than many deeds that he had
already done. He sent a troop of his soldiers to Bethlehem,
with orders to go into every house in the village,
to find every child that was two years old or under that
age, and to kill them all. This terrible thing the soldiers
did, and a great cry went up to heaven from the mothers
and fathers whose little ones had been slain by the wicked
king's command.</p>

<p>But Herod's slaughter of the little children was all
in vain, as must be every attempt to fight against God.
Herod thought that surely this royal child must be
among those little dead bodies in Bethlehem, and that
his throne was safe. But by that time the little Jesus
was in Egypt, sleeping under one of its palm trees beside
the river Nile, or looking with wide-open baby eyes upon
the pyramids and the Sphinx, the wonderful works of
ancient time, carved in stone.</p>

<p>Herod did not live long after this. He died full of
years, full of wickedness, and suffering great pain. Then
Joseph in Egypt dreamed again. The angel whom he had
seen so many times before came once more and said to him:</p>

<p>"Joseph, you may now take the young child and
his mother and go back to the land of the Jews, for those
who sought to kill the child are dead and can do him
no harm."</p>

<p>Then Joseph as before fastened a saddle on the ass
and placed their possessions upon its back. The little
family then set out upon its journey back to the land of
Judea. The purpose of Joseph and Mary was to go back
to Bethlehem, David's city, and there bring up this child
whom they expected one day to sit on David's throne
as King of Israel. But on the way they met other
travelers and asked them:</p>

<p>"Who is now the King in Judea, since Herod is
dead?" They said to Joseph:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"The king over Jerusalem and Judea is now Archelaus,
the son of the old King Herod, and he is as wicked
and as cruel as his father was before him."</p>

<p>This news made Joseph and Mary afraid to go to
Bethlehem. They thought, "Perhaps King Archelaus
may have heard of the child Jesus, and is watching for
the chance to kill him."</p>

<p>They made up their mind not to go near Bethlehem
or Jerusalem, but keeping away from the land ruled by
Archelaus, to return to Nazareth, where both had lived
before their marriage. So it came to pass that Jesus
who was born in Bethlehem of Judea was brought up in
Nazareth of Galilee.</p>

<h2>A Child's Life in Nazareth</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 11</div>


<div class='cap'>THE LITTLE Jesus must have been between two
and five years old when he was brought to Nazareth,
just coming out of babyhood and growing into a
little boy; and Nazareth was his home for at least
twenty-five years, all through his childhood, his boyhood
and his young manhood.</div>

<p>Jesus was not the only child living in that little
white house of one story and one room on the side of the
hill. Soon another baby boy came, who was named
James, who grew up to become a great man, and many
years after wrote one of the books in the Bible, the
Epistle of James. Then, one after another, came three
more boys, Joseph and Simon and Judas. When we
read that name "Judas" we are apt to think of the wicked
Judas, who sold the Lord Jesus for a few pieces of silver.
But that was a different Judas. This Judas, like his
brother James, long afterward wrote another book in the
New Testament, the Epistle of Jude. Somewhere in the
list of children were two girls&mdash;there may have been more
than two, but the number and names of the girls have
not been kept.</p>

<p>After a few years that little house must often have
been crowded, with children coming one after another,
and always a baby to be cared for. And much of the
time it was the shop where father Joseph did his work as a
carpenter. The floor of brick or of clay was often littered
with shavings and the workman's tools were on the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus-088.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The child Jesus loved outdoor life, he knew the flowers that grew in the fields
and the birds flying in the air.</span>
</div>

<p>The house had very little furniture; no chairs, no
bedstead with a mattress upon it, no stove and no pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
upon the walls. In one corner a little fire was lighted for
cooking the meals, and the smoke went up through a
hole in the roof, unless the wind blew it back into the
room. They never made a fire to keep the house warm
in winter, but when it was cold just waited for the sun to
come out. Sometimes a snowstorm came, but the snow
seldom stayed more than two or three days. The
children of Joseph never took a sleigh-ride and never
coasted on sleds down the steep hills.</p>

<p>If there was a table for their meals, it was very low,
less than two feet high; and they sat around it on little
cushions, dipping their hands or pieces of bread into one
common dish for food. Sometimes the table was just a
round measure turned upside down; and sometimes the
meal was served on the floor, as we serve meals on the
grass at a picnic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>When night came, they unrolled some mats, which
through the day were rolled up and stood against the
wall, spread them on the floor and lay down upon them
to sleep, throwing over themselves the long mantle
which had been their outside garment through the day.
When the door was shut, the house was dark, for its
only window was a little hole in the wall; and they
lighted it by an oil lamp, which stood either on a tall
stand or on a little shelf.</p>

<p>But the house was used little in the daytime, for
everybody lived out of doors, in the open court in front,
in the streets and on the hills around. On pleasant days
Joseph took his tools in the court and worked in wood.
We are apt to think of Joseph as building houses, as in
our time that is the chief work of a carpenter. But the
houses were made of clay or rough stone, and the carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
did very little work upon them. His chief business
was in making wooden plows, yokes for the oxen, the
little tables, and the peck or bushel measure, which was
to be found in every house, and was also used in place of
a table.</p>

<p>One very useful article was either in the house or in
the court&mdash;the hand mill for grinding grain, made of two
round flat stones. Our flour comes to us from great
factories, but in that land each family had its own little
mill. They poured the grain into a hole in the upper
millstone, and then turned the stone round and round
by a handle until the grain was ground into flour. This
was hard work, but it was always done by the women.
Often two women helped each other to turn the handle
of the upper millstone. Mary's arms often ached in
making the flour needed for her large family. When her
daughters grew strong, they helped her in this work.</p>

<p>When Jesus became a boy six years old, he was sent
to school with the other boys. There were no schools
for girls among the Jews, so far as we know. The school
was held in the village church, which they called the
synagogue. The teacher was always a man, and he was
generally the janitor of the church, who kept the building
in order.</p>

<p>The Jews had a pretty name for the village school.
They called it "The Vineyard," as though the children
were bunches of little grapes, growing up to ripen in the
sun. In this vineyard-school there was only one book
for study. That was the Bible. The Jews had only the
Old Testament, for the New Testament had not yet
been written. Each of the larger books was in a separate
volume in the form of a long roll of parchment; that is,
a sheet made of sheepskin which had been made smooth,
on which the words were written. Several of the smaller
books were written on one roll. In the school there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
only one copy of the Bible for all the scholars, but each
boy had a board and a piece of chalk, with which he wrote
sentences from the Bible and then learned them by
heart. When his text had been learned, each pupil
cleaned off his board like a slate and wrote on it a new
lesson. All the teaching in a Jewish school was in the
Old Testament.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-092.jpg" width="300" height="389" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Roll of book</span>
</div>

<p>The copy of the Bible in the school was generally
one that had been used in the church until it had grown
old and worn out. When
they obtained a new set of
the books for the service
in the church, they gave
the old copies to the school.</p>

<p>You can see in that
same land now a school
of children just like those
in the time when Jesus was
a boy. The children sit on
the floor in a circle, the
teacher being one of the
ring. When they repeat
their verses in learning
them, all are talking aloud
at the same time, so that
the school is very noisy.
We could not study in such a din, but they do not seem
to mind it.</p>


<p>School was not very hard in that country. Our
children have one holiday in each week, free from school,
but in the school where Jesus was taught, they had two
holidays in every week, besides the sabbath. In addition
to these holidays there was a long recess of three hours in
the middle of each day, and no school at all if the day was
very hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When Jesus was a small boy he was taken by father
Joseph to the church, which you remember they called
the synagogue. The men and boys sat on the floor upon
rugs or mats, while the women and girls were in a gallery,
looking down upon them. All the men and boys wore
their hats in the church. Their hats were turbans of
cloth wrapped around their heads. But each one as he
entered the door slipped off his shoes or slippers, and was
barefooted in the church at the hour of worship. If
at the hour of worship you go to a Mohammedan church
in that country&mdash;which they call a mosque&mdash;you will
see all the shoes standing outside the door.</p>

<p>In the church they had no minister to lead the
service and to preach a sermon. The men took turns
in charge of the worship. One read from one part of the
Old Testament, another from another part. If they
found a boy who was a good reader he was often called
upon to read the Bible in the church service. They had
prayers, always read from a book; they sang together
from the Psalms; and whoever wished to speak could
do so.</p>

<p>But we are not to think of the child Jesus as always
at school or at church. He was a strong, hearty, healthy
boy. He loved outdoor life, he knew the flowers that
grew in the fields and the birds flying in the air. He
played with other boys and knew all their games. Two
of these games he once happened to mention long after,
while he was teaching. One game was the wedding,
when they sang and danced; the other was the funeral,
when they cried with loud voices, making a mournful
wail. We know, too, that in those times the boys played
ball and marbles, and a game somewhat like ten-pins.</p>

<p>Jesus was not a lonely boy, living apart. He was
always fond of having others around him. When he was
a man, traveling and teaching over all the land, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his twelve chosen friends who were always with him,
and we may be sure that as a boy he liked to be with other
boys, and in turn was liked by the boys of his village.</p>

<p>We may be sure, too, that he grew up a good boy;
one who always tried to do right, at home, at school, or in
play. At home he would help Joseph in his shop and his
mother in her work or in caring for the smaller children;
in school we know that he learned his verses in the Bible,
because in after years he could always call them to his
mind and speak them; and in play he was always fair
and good-hearted and willing. We are told that he
grew in knowledge and in the favor of God and of all people.
In other words, he was a boy that everybody liked.</p>

<h2>The Boy Lost and Found</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 12</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS STAYED at the school in the village church
until he was twelve years old. By that time he
could read and write and could also repeat many
verses. But as his reading book and spelling book and
copy book and memory verses were all in the Bible, and
as he heard long readings from its books at the church
service, we may be sure that he knew quite well all the
best things in that best of all books, the Bible. One
proof of this is that in later years, when anyone tried to
puzzle him with a hard question, he often answered
promptly with a sentence from the Bible.</div>

<p>A Jewish boy generally left school at the age of
twelve, unless he wished to become a rabbi, which was
the name among the Jews for a teacher of their law. If
that was his wish or the purpose of his parents, he was
sent up to Jerusalem to study in the college held by the
scribes or teachers in the Temple. Saul of Tarsus, a boy
about four years younger than Jesus, whom we know as
Paul the Apostle, was a student in the Temple college,
but Jesus was not. While the young Saul was studying
in Jerusalem, Jesus as a young man was working in the
carpenter shop at Nazareth.</p>

<p>When Jesus was twelve years old he was taken on
his first journey from Nazareth up to Jerusalem to
attend the great feast of the Passover. Three great
feasts were held during the year. The feast of the
Passover was in the early spring, and kept in mind the
great day when the Israelites went out of Egypt, no
longer slaves but free men. The feast of the Pentecost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was held in the late spring, just fifty days after the
Passover&mdash;the word "pentecost" meaning "fifty days"&mdash;and
reminded the people that fifty days after their
fathers went out of Egypt, God gave them their law
amid lightning and thunder on Mount Sinai. The feast
of the Tabernacles, or "feast of tents" (for that is the
meaning of the word tabernacles), was held in the fall;
and at this time the people built for themselves huts of
green branches, ate in them and slept in them for a week,
to show the outdoor life of the early days in the wilderness,
while they were marching to Canaan, the Promised
Land. These three great feasts were held in Jerusalem,
and from every part of the land the people came up to
the city to attend them.</p>

<p>It was a great event when the boy Jesus for the first
time went on this journey to Jerusalem. The younger
children were left at home, under the care of some friend,
for a boy did not begin attending these feasts until he
was twelve years old. Of course, Joseph and Mary knew
all about this journey, for they had made it many times.
They went in the caravan or company from Nazareth,
following the road that Joseph and Mary had taken on
their way to Bethlehem, twelve years before. As they
journeyed, Mary seated on the ass, Joseph and the boy
Jesus walking beside her, they would talk about the
places which they passed, and the stories of old times
told about them. Jesus knew all those stories, for every
Jewish boy had heard them, over and over.</p>

<p>As they paused on the top of the hill beside Nazareth,
below them was spread out the great plain of Esdraelon,
and they would say, "That mountain by the Great Sea
on the west is Mount Carmel, where Elijah built his
altar and made his great offering, when in answer to his
prayer the fire came down from heaven and burned up
the bullock laid on the altar. Do you see that road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
running across the plain? On that road Elijah ran in
front of King Ahab's chariot, after the long drought,
when the rain was coming. And then, this plain! Over
it from Mount Tabor, there on the left, Deborah and
Barak chased the flying Canaanites across the plain.
Do you see that second mountain beyond Tabor? That
is Mount Gilboa; and at its foot Gideon with his brave
three hundred frightened at night the Midianite host
and won a great victory."</p>

<span class="caption">Mount Tabor and the plain of Esdraelon</span>
</div>

<p>They went down into the Jordan valley and walked
southward by the Roman road, following the Jordan
River. At one place the mountains on either side came
down close to the river, and there was barely room for
the road between the foaming stream on one side and the
steep rocks on the other.</p>

<p>"Look," said Joseph, "this <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">is</ins> the place where the
waters rose up and stood in a heap when our fathers under
Joshua were about to cross the river, thirty miles
below."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>They crossed a brook which fell into the river; and
Joseph said, "Do you see this brook? Up there among
the mountains was the place where the prophet Elijah
was fed by the ravens; for this is the brook Cherith."</p>

<p>They came to the place just above Jericho where
under Joshua the Israelites walked across the dry bed
of the river, the holy ark carried by the priests in front
and the people following in a long procession. There
the river is very wide and quite shallow, so that people
walk across, except in the early spring, when it is swollen
by the rains and the melting snow on the high mountains
far to the north.</p>

</div>

<p>There they would point out across the river Mount
Nebo, where Moses stood looking upon the land and then
all alone lay down and died. They stopped for a rest at
Jericho, where were stories to tell of the walls that fell
down when the Israelites marched around them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the priests blew their ram's-horn trumpets. Perhaps
they stopped and drank at the great spring near Jericho
where the water was made pure by Elisha the prophet.
And after a climb up to the mountains, at the end of six
days or a week, they came to Jerusalem, the end of their
journey, and the place called by the people "the holy
city."</p>

<p>And then, there was the splendid Temple of God!
How the boy's heart was stirred as he walked over the
bridge leading from Mount Zion to Mount Moriah!
They went into the great outside court, the court of the
Gentiles, the only place in the Temple where foreigners
were allowed to enter; and the boy Jesus was shocked
to see that it had been turned into a market, where
cattle and sheep and doves were sold, and where tables
stood around for the men who changed foreign money
into Jewish shekels.</p>

<p>Over the eastern wall and the Golden Gate, they
saw the Mount of Olives, then covered to the top with
vineyards and olive trees and gardens. They climbed
up a flight of steps and passed through a gate called
"the Beautiful Gate," into a smaller court, like the
outer court open to the sky. This was named "The
Court of the Women" because from its lattice-covered
gallery the women looked down on the altar and the
services of worship. Jesus noticed that in this Court of
the Women were many classes of young men studying,
seated in a circle, listening to their teachers. How he
longed to sit down among them and listen to these wise
scholars; for though only a boy, he had thought deeply
on many things which he had read, and many questions
had come to his mind which he greatly desired to have
answered. He saw the sacrifice offerings laid on the altar
and burned, while trumpets sounded and censers of incense
were waved and the priests chanted the psalms of David.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>While the family were in Jerusalem they found
friends with whom they stayed, and in their house the
Passover feast was eaten. It was a very simple meal,
just a roasted lamb, some vegetables and bread made
without yeast, in thin cakes, like soda biscuit, only larger.
They ate the meal
lying down on
couches around
the table, their
heads toward the
table, their feet
away from it. It
was the custom
or rule of the Jews,
at this feast, to
have the story of
the first Passover.
Perhaps Joseph
said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"My son, you
know what took
place when this
passover was
eaten for the first
time. Tell us the
story."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/illus-102.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">David street, Jerusalem, looking toward Olivet</span>
</div>

<p>Then the boy
Jesus told of the
terrible plagues that fell upon the land of Egypt; of
the last and greatest sorrow, the death of the oldest
son in every house; how the Israelites sprinkled their
door-posts with the blood of the slain lamb and were
passed over by this death-angel; how they ate the lamb
on that night, dressed for their journey; and how they
went out of Egypt and marched through the Red Sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The family were in Jerusalem for a week, and every
day Jesus went up to the Temple to worship in its services
and to learn what he could from its teachers. The last
day of their visit came, and at its close the families
going to Galilee met together for their homeward journey.
A horn was blown and the caravan or company started
northward. Mary missed her son, but thought that he
was somewhere in the crowd, talking with other boys
of his own age. But when night came, the company
stopped to rest and Jesus did not appear. Mary was
alarmed. They looked through all the crowd, but no
Jesus was to be found.</p>

<p>Then in great trouble, Joseph and Mary hastened
back to Jerusalem, looking for their boy. They asked
for him among the friends at whose house they had stayed,
but he had not been there. They wandered up and
down the narrow streets, but while they saw many groups
of boys, their boy was not among them. At last, on the
third day, they looked for him in the Temple. In one
of its courts a crowd of people were listening to the
teachers who seemed to be talking with someone.
They drew near, and Mary's heart began to beat
as she suddenly heard a boy's voice sounding from
the middle of the throng. She knew that voice, in
its clear, rich, honest tone! She pressed her way
in; and there stood her boy, the center of a company
of the learned scholars. He was asking questions
of these men, and they in their answers were asking
him questions in turn, while all around were people
listening and wondering at this boy's deep knowledge of
the truth.</p>

<p>Mary hastily rushed up to Jesus, and said:</p>

<p>"My son, why have you treated us so unkindly?
Your father and I have been looking for you, in great
trouble, for three days!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus looked up at his mother's face, with surprise,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why should you look for me? Did you not know
that I would be in my Father's house?"</p>

<p>Evidently on the last day of their stay, he had slipped
away for one more visit to the Temple; and once there
his mind and heart had been so full that no thought of
the home-going had come to him. He had just stayed
there in the courts of the Lord's house without a thought
of the outside world.</p>

<p>Where had he slept on those two nights? Who had
given him food during those three days? He might
have lain down, as thousands did during the feast, under
the olive trees on the Mount of Olives. Some stranger
may have seen him and invited him to a meal. But it
would not be strange if in his deep, whole-souled interest,
he had never thought of food and had eaten nothing
during those three days.</p>

<p>But without a word he took his mother's hand and
walked out of the Temple. He made the journey home
to Nazareth, saying little but thinking much of all that
he had seen and heard. One great, precious truth at
least had come home to his heart. He felt that the Lord
God of Israel was his own Father and he could trust
fully the Father God.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Young Woodworker</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 13</div>


<div class='cap'>FOR EIGHTEEN years after the visit to the Temple,
Jesus was living in Nazareth, growing up from a
boy to a young man. A Jewish boy generally left
his school at about thirteen years of age, and began
working at some trade or business. Jesus went into
Joseph's shop and helped in the work, making plows and
ax-handles and rakes and the plain furniture for the
houses. Whatever Jesus did was done well, and we
cannot doubt that in his trade he soon became a skilful
worker. His ax-handles and plows were as good as the
best; and if he made a bushel measure, it was a true
one, for Jesus was a boy that could be trusted.</div>

<p>As a boy, he was like other boys, playing happily in
play-time and working heartily in work-time. Some
boys like to be alone, reading and thinking and dreaming;
but Jesus was not one of that kind. All through his
life he liked to have people around him, and as a boy we
may be sure he had many friends among other boys.
He was strong, in good health, could run and jump and
climb trees. With his boy friends he wandered among
the mountains and upon the great plain just over the
hills from his town. The Sea of Galilee was only twenty
miles away, and we do not doubt that Jesus with his
friends went fishing in its blue waters and brought home
to his mother the fish which he had caught.</p>

</div>
<p>After a time, Joseph, the husband of Mary, died,
and Jesus was left to care for his mother and her large
family of children. It is no light load for one just
coming out of boyhood and just beginning to be a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to have laid upon him the earning of enough money to
buy food for a mother and at least six younger brothers
and sisters; and this was the load which the young
Jesus took up. But although Joseph who had been a
father to him was gone, Jesus knew that his heavenly
Father was still with
him, and he could
call upon him for
help in every need.</p>

<p>Jesus worked
hard all the long
days, but when the
Sabbath day came,
which among the
Jews was Saturday,
his shop was shut up
and he sat on the
floor of the village
church, listening to
the reading of the Old
Testament and joining
in the songs of
praise. He took his
turn as the reader
at the desk, and as
he read the lesson in
Isaiah or Micah or
Hosea, he saw meanings
in the verses that
others could not see, for in the long hours of the workshop
he was thinking and praying and listening to the voice
of God.</p>



<p>While Jesus was living this quiet life in the home and
the shop some changes were going on in the land. The
ruler in Galilee was Herod Antipas, the son of that wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Herod who killed all the babies in Bethlehem; and
he was very little better than his father. In Judea,
the part of the land around Jerusalem, Archelaus,
another son of Herod, ruled so badly that all the people
sent to the Emperor Tiberius at Rome asking to have
him taken away. The Jews hoped that they might then
have rulers of their own people; but the Emperor sent
them a Roman governor, whom they did not like but
dared not make angry. In many places through the
land, especially in Galilee, where Jesus was living, some
of the people refused to pay their taxes to the Roman
empire, and began fighting against the rulers. They
could not battle with the Roman armies, and hid in the
woods and caves and mountains, but came out in bands
and robbed the people on the roads. All through the
land, north and south, were fear and trouble. The
people were not contented with their rulers, and all
hoped that the time was near when the Kingdom of God
would come and their Roman officers and tax-gatherers
would be driven away. They looked for a kingdom like
the one over which David reigned a thousand years
before, a kingdom with armies and victories over its
enemies and a palace for the king.</p>

<p>But they did not know that in that little one-room
house on the hillside of Nazareth, the King was waiting
for his call to go forth and bring in the true Kingdom
of God.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Voice by the River</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 14</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was still living in Nazareth and
working in his carpenter shop, suddenly the
news went through all the land that a strange
man was preaching in the desert country of Judea, not
far from Jerusalem; and that all the people were going
out of the cities and villages to hear him.</div>

<p>This man was John, the son of the old priest
Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth. You remember that
an angel came to Zacharias while he was standing by the
altar in the Temple, and told him that he should have a
son, and that his name should be John. John had now
grown up and was a young man about thirty years old.
He had lived out in the desert places away from the
cities and their crowds, so that he could be alone and
think and pray and listen to the voice of God. And
God had spoken to him in the desert and he had told
him to preach to the people and tell them how to get
ready for the Kingdom of God, which was soon to come.</p>

<span class="caption">John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness</span>
</div>

<p>John was preaching beside the river Jordan, at the
foot of the mountains; and from the cities and villages
everywhere the people went to listen to his words. John
did not look like the men of his time. He had never
cut his hair, and it hung upon his shoulders in a long
black mass. His black beard, too, was very long, for it
had never been trimmed. His clothing was a skin torn
from a beast or a mantle woven from the rough, shaggy
hair of the camel, fastened by a leather belt around the
waist. He had lived out of doors in the sun and the
winds and the rain, so that his face and arms and legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and his bare feet were all brown and hard. He ate for
his food the locusts which he could pick up in the fields
and the woods and the honey to be found in the hollow
trees. When the people looked at him, they thought of
the great prophet Elijah, who many hundred years before
had gone up to heaven in a chariot of fire near that
very place where John was preaching, and they said
wonderingly to each other:</p>

<p>"This must be Elijah, the fiery prophet, who has
come back to earth."</p>

<p>A prophet among the Israelites was a man who
brought to the people the word which God had given
him to speak. The books of the Old Testament, which
all the people knew almost by heart, told of many
prophets, such as Moses, who brought water for his
people by striking the rock; Samuel, whose prayers
saved the people from their enemies; Nathan, who spoke
bold words to David the king; and Elisha, who had
made the bitter waters of a spring sweet, had cured the
leper Naaman and wrought many wonderful works.
Of all the prophets, they thought Elijah the greatest,
and they remembered that in the last book of the Old
Testament, the book of the prophet Malachi, it was
written:</p>

<p>"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before
the great day of the Lord shall come."</p>

<p>And when the people looked at this strange man
who was preaching by the river, they thought that the
day of the Lord was surely coming, and that here was
the prophet Elijah as had been promised.</p>

<p>John said to the people, in his preaching, that the
Kingdom of God was near at hand and that every man
must be ready for it. To make themselves ready, they
were to confess their sins, to stop doing wrong and to
begin to do right. As a sign of their willingness to cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
from evil and to serve the Lord, they were baptized by
John in the river Jordan. John said to them:</p>

<p>"I baptize you with water, but there is one among
you, of your own people, one whom you do not know,
who is greater than I, so much above me that I am not
worthy to stoop down and tie his shoestrings. He will
come soon; and when he comes, he will not baptize with
water as I do. He will baptize you with fire and with
the Spirit of God."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-112.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">The river Jordan</span>
</div>

<p>He spoke further about this Greater One who was
coming so soon, and said:</p>

<p>"He shall deal with the people as the farmer deals
with his grain on the threshing floor. He will sweep the
floor most carefully; the wheat he will put in his barn
and the chaff he will burn up with a fire that cannot
be put out."</p>

<p>The people came to John and said to him:</p>

<p>"What shall we do to make ready for the coming of
this Great King?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>John answered them:</p>

<p>"Let everyone do what he can to help those who are
in need. If any of you have two coats, give one of them
to some poor man that has no garments; and those of
you who have wheat and barley, give to those who are
hungry something to eat."</p>

<p>Some of the men who gathered the taxes from the
people for the Roman rulers came to John and said:</p>

<p>"What would you have us do to make ready for
the coming of the King? Shall we tell the people that
they are to pay no more taxes?"</p>

<p>"No," answered John. "Let the people pay their
taxes as before; but see that you do not make them pay
more than is right, and do not rob them."</p>

<p>For many of these tax-collectors (who were called
publicans) took from the people more than they had a
right to take, and used the people's money for themselves.
They made themselves rich by robbing the
people. Everywhere the people hated these tax-collectors,
and called them "sinners."</p>

<p>The soldiers and policemen came to John and said,
"And what shall we do?"</p>

<p>John said to them:</p>

<p>"Do not be harsh and rough with the people. Treat
everyone kindly. Be contented with your pay, and do
not make the people give you money that you have no
right to ask."</p>

<p>These were some of the many things that John said
to the people. All his words came to this: "If you are
doing wrong, stop it and begin to do right. Do not be
selfish, but love your fellow men and do good to them.
And be ready when the King comes to obey him."</p>

<p>John was called "John the Baptist" because he
baptized in the river Jordan all those who promised to
follow his teachings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The leaders of the people in Jerusalem did not
believe the words of John and were not baptized by him.
They did not know exactly what to think of him, and
they sent some priests and others to see him. These
men came and asked him:</p>

<p>"Who are you? Are you the Christ, the promised
King?"</p>

<p>"No," answered John, "I am not the Christ."</p>

<p>"What then?" said they. "Are you Elijah the
prophet come to earth again, as some people say
you are?"</p>

<p>"No," answered John again, "I am not Elijah."</p>

<p>"Well, then," they said, "tell us who you are, so
that we can give an answer to the rulers who have
sent us."</p>

<p>And John said:</p>

<p>"In the book of the prophet Isaiah it is written,
'The Voice of him that cries in the desert: prepare ye
the way of the Lord, make a straight path before him.'
I am that voice to speak to the people and make them
ready for the King, who is even now among you,
although you do not know him, and who will soon make
himself known."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Carpenter Leaves His Shop</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 15</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER SOME months the news was brought to
Nazareth that John the Baptist had come up the
river Jordan and was now preaching at a place
about twelve miles south of the Sea of Galilee. The
place where John was preaching had two names. It
was called "Bethany beyond Jordan," there being
another Bethany quite near Jerusalem; and it was also
called "Bethabara," a word which means "the place
where one can walk across the river"; for there the river
Jordan was so shallow that people waded across it.
John had chosen this place because the sloping shore
beside the river was fitted for the crowds to listen to
his preaching, and the shallow water was near at hand
for baptizing the people.</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-116.jpg" width="300" height="285" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The Jordan. At the supposed place of
Christ&#39;s baptism.</span>
</div>

<p>Bethabara or Bethany was about twenty-five miles
from Nazareth; and over the plain just across the hill
was a road leading down to the river at that place, where
people used to cross the Jordan on their way to the land
of Decapolis and Perea beyond. Nearly all the people
had heard John preach, and most of them had been
baptized by him as a sign that they promised to turn
from evil and do good and look for the King who was
soon to come.</p>

<p>Jesus felt that the time had now come for him to
begin the work to which God had called him. He had
told no one of his purpose, not even his mother; but
one day he left his carpenter shop to his younger
brothers, who were now young men and able to care for
their mother. He walked down the valleys, came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
river Jordan, waded the stream, and at Bethabara, in
front of a crowd of people from every part of the land,
for the first time he saw John the Baptist. No doubt
Mary had told her son all the story of the angel by the
altar, of John's birth and of his early life; but in all the
years Jesus and John had never met.</p>

<p>Jesus listened to the words of John, and then with
the others he came forward to be baptized. John looked
at this strange young man who was drawing near, and
as he looked the voice within him said:</p>

<p>"The long-promised
King has come! This
Man is He!"</p>

<p>John felt that here
was one who needed no
baptism; for he knew
that this man had no sins
to give up, and was already
doing God's will
perfectly. He felt unwilling
to baptize him, and
said:</p>


<p>"It is not fitting that
I should baptize one so
good and so great in the sight of God as you are. I need
to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</p>

<p>But Jesus answered him:</p>

<p>"It is best that it should be so. Whatever is right
for other men is right also for me. Let me do this as
my duty to God."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/illus-117.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">As Jesus rose out of the water, a light flashed from the sky, resting on his head,
and the voice of God was heard saying: &quot;This is my Son, my
Beloved, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then John yielded to the will of Jesus and baptized
him. Just as Jesus rose out of the water a strange
thing happened. While he was praying a light flashed
from the sky and seemed to rest upon the head of Jesus
like a white, shining dove coming down upon him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a voice was heard somewhat like a peal of thunder.
Those standing on the shore felt that some words were
spoken, but they could not understand them. John
alone heard and understood. It was the voice of God,
and John afterward told the people that these were the
words spoken:</p>

<p>"This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom I am well
pleased."</p>

<p>At that instant a mighty Power came upon Jesus.
The Spirit of God had always been with him and had
caused him to feel that the Lord was fitting him to do
some great work. But in that moment when the light
from heaven fell upon him and the voice of God was
heard, Jesus was filled with the Spirit of God as no man,
not even the greatest of the prophets, had been filled
before. He knew now that he was not only a prophet,
one who hears God's voice and speaks God's words;
but more than a prophet, he himself was the Son of God.
He saw as in a flash what was God's plan for his kingdom
on the earth; and that it was a kingdom far different
from that expected by the Jewish people. He
knew that he, who up to that moment had been the
woodworker of Nazareth, was from that hour to be the
Prince of the heavenly kingdom. He was to lead the
people to God and to show in his own life how men
should live. He was to bring God down to men and to
bring men to God. All this and more that we cannot
understand came to the soul of Jesus as he stood on the
brink of Jordan with the light of God upon his face.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>




<h2>Alone in the Desert</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 16</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER HIS baptism Jesus felt that for a time he
must be alone to think over the great change that
had come upon him. Only yesterday he had been
the carpenter in Nazareth, and now he knew that he was
the Son of God and the King of Israel! So sudden and
mighty a change as this made him feel that he must go
to some quiet, lonely place, where he could think and
pray and find out his Father's will for himself and the
work that he was to do.</div>

<p>Without speaking even a word with John, Jesus
slipped out of the crowd upon the bank of the river. He
walked toward the south, not following the well-known
road beside the Jordan, over which he had walked many
times while attending the feasts in Jerusalem, but choosing
the paths along the mountain-side where he would
not meet people, for he wished not to talk with men but
with God.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus-120.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus chose the paths along the mountainside where he would not meet people,
for he wished not to talk with men but with God.</span>
</div>

<p>He came at last to a very lonely place, between
Jericho and Jerusalem; a place where no man lived and
where even the Arabs of the desert scarcely ever wandered.
The only living creatures in the desolate land
were the wild beasts, the wolves and the foxes, whose
howls could be heard at night. There upon the top of a
hill, with rocks all around, he sat down to rest. His
mind had been in such a whirl of excitement, and his
heart was beating with such strong feeling, that he had
never thought of taking with him any food to eat. For
many days and nights he was alone, praying and talking
with God and never once thinking of eating. More than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a month passed away, even forty days, before the feeling
of hunger came upon him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he felt a sharp gnawing in his body,
and he knew that he was famishing for food. He felt
that he must have something to eat or he would die there
in the desert, with the great work to which God had
called him all left undone. Around him were the rough
stones of the wilderness, and as he looked on them, this
thought came to his mind:</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to starve in this desert.
If I am the Son of God, as the voice from heaven said,
then I need only to speak a word and these stones will be
turned to bread!"</p>

<p>Then Jesus thought again, and said to himself,
"Yes, I am the Son of God, and I have the power to
make these stones turn into bread for me to eat. But
that power was given me by my heavenly Father; and
it was given, not that I should use it for myself, but for
the help of others who are in need. It is not God's will
that I should make bread out of stones for myself."</p>

<p>And then a sentence out of the Bible came to the
mind of Jesus, and he said, "It is written, Man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out
of the mouth of God."</p>

<p>Jesus seemed to be alone in the desert, but there was
one who was watching him, all unseen. That one was the
evil spirit, Satan, who hated Jesus, knowing that he was
the Son of God and the Saviour of the world. He had
put into the mind of Jesus the thought of turning stones
to bread and using the power which God had given him
for himself alone. Jesus was quick to see the purpose
of Satan and to turn away from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/illus-122.jpg" width="398" height="600" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">When Satan, the wicked spirit, found that he could not persuade Jesus to
do his will, he left him.</span>
</div>

<p>Then another thought came to the mind of Jesus.
He said to himself, "I know that I am the King of Israel,
the Messiah whom the people have been looking for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
long. But how shall I cause the people to know that I am
their King? What can I do to make them believe in me?"</p>

<p>At that moment, while Jesus was trying to think
out the best plan for beginning his work and making
himself, as the Son of God, known to the people, Satan,
the evil spirit, was ready with another word. He said,
"Here is a good plan. Go to the Temple in Jerusalem
at some feast-time when it is crowded with people,
and in the sight of all the crowd, leap off one of the
towers. You will not fall to the ground, but will come
sailing down through the air, for all power is yours.
And when the people see you, they will fall on their faces
before you and will believe in you as the King so long
promised. You know that you are the Son of God and
that God will take care of you. Don't you remember
that in one of the psalms it is written, 'He shall give his
angels charge over thee, and in their hands they shall
bear thee up so that thou shalt not dash thy foot against
a stone?'"</p>

<p>Jesus saw at once that this was not God's plan, but
Satan's plan. It would not be trusting God, but would
be putting God's power and God's care to a trial to show
what Jesus himself could do. He would not perform
this foolish act, nor anything like it, of his own accord.
He would wait until God told him what to do, and would
do nothing until he was sure that it was the will of God.
Again a sentence out of the Bible came to his mind, and
he said:</p>

<p>"It is written again, 'Thou shall not put the Lord
thy God to trial.'"</p>

<p>That means that we should never make a show of our
trust in God or let others see by some act that is not
needed what God can do to help us. We must not
venture into danger to show how God can bring us out
of danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus had now settled two great questions. He
would not use his wonder-working powers for himself,
even to save his own life; and he would do nothing
merely as a show, but would in all things work only the
will of his Father. There was one more question to be
met: he was to become the King of Israel, but what kind
of a kingdom would he have?</p>

<p>He knew well that all the Israelite people, not only
in Judea and Galilee, but in all the lands, were looking
for a king who should rule in Jerusalem, somewhat as the
Emperor Tiberius was ruling in Rome. They hoped for a
king who should gather an army, should drive out the
Romans, should fight battles, win victories and make his
kingdom the ruling power in the world. They looked
for the time when the Romans should be under their
feet, and when all other lands should pay taxes and serve
their king in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>All this Jesus knew, and Satan, the wicked spirit,
was at his side, though unseen, to say to him:</p>

<p>"Take my advice, and I will give you all the kingdoms
of the world; for they are mine and I can give them
to whom I please."</p>

<p>Jesus knew that what the people wanted was just
what Satan wanted, a worldly, wicked kingdom, built
out of war and blood and the killing of all who would not
submit to it. But that would not be the Kingdom of
God. It would be the Kingdom of Satan, as so many
kingdoms and nations have been in the past. To do as
Satan wished him to do would be just the same as if
he bowed down before Satan and worshipped him as his
Lord and Master. This he would not do; and his last
words to the tempter were:</p>

<p>"Go away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve!'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus saw plainly that in making this great choice
to please God, he would not please his own people, the
Jews. He knew that the rulers and the priests and the
scribes, those who were the leading men of the time,
would be against him, would refuse to follow him, would
try to stir up the people against him and would try to
kill him. But Jesus was ready to die in serving God,
rather than to live in doing the will of Satan.</p>

<p>When Satan, the wicked spirit, found that he could
not persuade Jesus to do his will, he left him. And afterward,
angels from heaven, sent by his Father, came to him
in the desert and gave him all the food that he needed.</p>

<p>The gospels of Matthew and Luke, which tell the
story of this meeting with Satan and of Jesus' victory,
do not say just where it took place. All we know is that
it was in the "desert" or the "wilderness." But near
Jericho stands a mountain where it is thought by some
that Jesus stayed during those forty days. This mountain
on that account is called by a name which means
"forty days"&mdash;Mount Quarantania.</p>

<h2>The Earliest Followers of Jesus</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 17</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER HIS forty days in the desert, Jesus began his
work of winning men to the Kingdom of God. This
plan was, at first, to talk to men one by one, until
he could gather around him a little company of those who
would believe in his words as a teacher, and follow him
as their leader. The men who would be best fitted to
become his first followers were some of those who had
been already taught by John the Baptist. So from the
wilderness Jesus turned his steps northward once more,
and walked up the well-trodden road toward Bethabara,
where nearly two months ago he had been baptized.</div>

<p>At Bethabara with John the Baptist was a group or
company of young men, who were known as John's
"disciples," that is, men who stayed with him to learn
his teachings after the crowds had gone home. Some
of these were fishermen from the Sea of Galilee who had
left their nets and their work that they might listen to
John.</p>

<p>John was standing with some of these men around
him, when at some distance a stranger was seen walking
up the road. These disciples of John did not know who
this man was, but John remembered him, for the light
flashing from the sky upon his face at the moment of his
baptism and the voice from the heavens, had stamped
Jesus upon his memory. He pointed to Jesus and said:</p>

<p>"Look! Yonder is the Lamb of God, who takes away
the sin of the world! This is the one of whom I spoke
when I said, 'After me shall come a man who is greater
than I, and who shall baptize not in water but in the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Spirit.' Upon this man I saw the Spirit coming down
like a dove and resting upon him. And I tell you all that
this man is the Son of God."</p>

<p>While John was speaking these words, Jesus passed
out of sight, and John and his disciples saw no more of
him that day. But on the next day, when John was
standing with two of his followers, Jesus again walked
by, and John again looked at him and said to the young
men:</p>

<p>"Look! The Lamb of God!"</p>

<p>The two young men when they heard these words
at once left John and walked toward Jesus. As they
drew near, Jesus turned and said to them:</p>

<p>"Why do you follow me? What is it that you wish?"</p>

<p>They said to him: "Teacher, we wish to know
where you are staying, so that we can see you and talk
with you."</p>

<p>"Come and see," said Jesus; and he led them to the
house where he was staying as a guest. In those times
the Jews welcomed to their homes those who were on a
journey and for a few days needed a resting place. It
was about ten o'clock in the morning when those two
men sat down in the house with Jesus, and they stayed
with him all the rest of the day until the sun went down,
listening as he talked to them about the Kingdom of
God. His words went straight to their hearts, and on
that day those two young men believed in Jesus as their
Messiah-Christ; that is, the King of Israel, long promised
by the prophets of the Old Testament and long looked
for by the Israelite people. The two words Messiah and
Christ mean the same. One is in the Hebrew language;
the other in the Greek, and both words mean "The
Anointed One," or "the King of Israel."</p>

<p>Thus, on the first day of his teaching Jesus found
two followers. Both of these men were fishermen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the Sea of Galilee, not many miles away. One was a
man named John, who was afterward called "the disciple
whom Jesus loved," for of all his followers, John was the
one nearest to Jesus. Long afterward, John wrote one
of the most precious books in the Bible, "the Gospel
according to John," which shows us, more than any
other book, the inmost heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>The other young man was named Andrew. He
thought at once of his older brother, Simon, who was also
a follower of John the Baptist. He went to find Simon,
and said to him:</p>

<p>"We have found the Messiah, of whom the prophets
have spoken!"</p>

<p>He spoke in the Hebrew tongue, which was the
language of his people. If he had spoken in Greek, the
tongue in which the New Testament was first written,
he would have said, "We have found the Christ;" that is,
the King. Andrew brought his brother Simon to Jesus;
and as soon as Jesus looked at him, before Andrew had
spoken his name, he said:</p>

<p>"Your name is Simon, and you are the son of Jonas.
But I will give you a new name. In the time to come
you shall be called 'the Rock.'"</p>

<p>In the Hebrew language the word meaning "rock"
is "Cephas" or "Kephas." In Greek it is "Peter."
After this Simon was sometimes called Cephas, but more
often Peter. He became a leader among the followers
of Jesus, and many years later wrote one, perhaps two,
of the books in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Jesus had now three followers who believed in him
as their Lord and King; and the next day he found a
fourth. This man was named Philip, and he came from
a place called Bethsaida, on the northern shore of the
Sea of Galilee. Jesus said to Philip:</p>

<p>"Follow me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>And he too joined the little company of the disciples
or followers of Jesus. Philip at once thought of a friend
of his own, a very good and pure man, who he thought
would be glad to join him as a follower of Jesus. He
went to look for him and found him standing under a
fig tree. He said:</p>

<p>"We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the
law, and of whom the prophets spoke, the Christ. His
name is Jesus, the son of Joseph; and he comes from the
town of Nazareth."</p>

<p>Now Nathanael's home-town was Cana, only a few
miles from Nazareth. Nathanael thought of Nazareth as a
mean place. He could not believe that the great King
of Israel, the Christ, should spring from such a village.
He looked for him to come from some great city, like
Jerusalem, or from Bethlehem, David's town. He did
not know that Jesus had been born in Bethlehem; in fact
he had never heard of Jesus, and he said:</p>

<p>"Do you tell me that anything good can come out of
Nazareth?"</p>

<p>Now, Philip was not wise enough to tell Nathanael
the reasons why he believed in Jesus. It is hard to put
into words some of our deepest thoughts. But he gave
to Nathanael a very wise answer.</p>

<p>"Well," said Philip, "come and see Jesus for yourself."</p>

<p>Jesus had never seen Nathanael before, but as he
drew near, Jesus said to those who were standing by:</p>

<p>"Look! here comes a true Israelite, a man of God,
one whose heart has in it nothing evil."</p>

<p>Nathanael was greatly surprised at these words of
Jesus. He said,</p>

<p>"How is it that you know me?"</p>

<p>"Before Philip spoke to you," answered Jesus,
"while you were standing under the fig tree, I saw you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Teacher," said Nathanael, "you are the Son of
God; you are the King of Israel."</p>

<p>Jesus said:</p>

<p>"Do you believe because I said, 'I saw you underneath
the fig tree?' You will yet see greater things than
these. In truth, I say to you that you shall see the heaven
opened and the angels of God going up and coming
down upon the Son of Man."</p>

<p>By "the Son of Man," Jesus meant himself. He
used those words to show that while he was "the Son
of God," he was also a man among men.</p>

<p>Jesus had been preaching or talking to a few men
about the Kingdom of God, and already he had gained
five followers. There may have been others, for not
long afterwards we find James, the brother of John,
among his disciples.</p>

<h2>The Water Turned to Wine</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 18</div>


<div class='cap'>SOON AFTER Jesus met the men who became his
first followers he left the river Jordan, and with
these men walked to the land of Galilee, to the
village of Cana, about six miles north of Nazareth.
This was the town where Nathanael, one of the first five
followers of Jesus, lived.</div>

<p>At Cana a marriage was to be held, and Jesus with
all his followers was invited. In that land, at a marriage,
a feast was always given, and all the friends of the newly-married
couple, with their friends also, and almost
everybody in the village, were expected to come. The
feasting and dancing and merry-making often lasted
through a whole week.</p>

<p>Before the feast was over they found that the wine,
which in those times everybody drank freely, was used
up, and those who were giving the feast had no wine to
set before their guests. This filled them with alarm, for
at such times the wine was expected to flow freely, and
not to have wine for the company at a feast was considered
almost a disgrace.</p>

<p>The mother of Jesus was there as a friend of the
family. She thought of a way to help those who were
giving the feast, and called her son aside from the crowd,
and said to him very quietly:</p>

<p>"They have no wine."</p>

<p>She knew what very few knew, that Jesus was the
Son of God, and that all power was in his hands. He
had not yet done any of those wonderful works of curing
the sick, making the blind to see and making the deaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to hear, which he did so often afterward; but Mary
believed that he could do them if he chose. She thought
that perhaps he would use his power to give the wine
that was needed. It was with this hope that she said
to him, "They have no wine."</p>

<p>The answer that Jesus gave was not such in its
words as to encourage
her.</p>

<p>"Woman," said
he, "what have you
to do with me in this
matter? My time
is not yet come."</p>

<p>His speaking to
his mother as "Woman,"
instead of saying
"Mother," as a
young man would
among us, was not
lacking in respect.
It was the usage of
that time for a son
to say "Woman,"
and not "Mother."
She saw in his face
a look showing her that she had not spoken in vain.
So she turned to the servants who were standing near.
"Whatever he tells you to do," she said, "do it."</p>

<span class="caption">Cana, and its well</span>
</div>

<p>One of the usages of the Jews was to wash their
hands before they sat down to a meal. This washing
was not merely to make their hands clean; it was a sort
of religious service, and the Jews were very strict in
doing it. When so large a company met for a feast, a
great deal of water was needed. In the hall were standing
six large jars for water, each jar of a size to hold nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
twenty gallons. They were nearly empty, because all
the guests had washed their hands before sitting down
at the feast. Jesus pointed to these jars and said to the
servants:</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/illus-135.png" width="348" height="300" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Stone water-jars</span>
</div>
<p>"Fill all those jars with water."</p>

<p>They obeyed him and filled all the jars up to the
brim. Then Jesus said again:</p>

<p>"Now draw out from the jars, and carry what you
take out to the ruler of the feast."</p>

<p>Wondering, the servants dipped their pitchers into
the great jars which only a few moments before they
had filled with water. How
surprised they were to find
each pitcher as it came out
full of red wine! They carried
it to the ruler of the
feast. He tasted it and saw
that it was wine of the very
best kind. He did not know
how it had been made, but
supposed that it had been
brought suddenly from some
wine merchant. He called the young man who had
been married, and in whose honor the feast was being
held, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Everybody serves his best wine at the beginning
of his feast; and afterward, when people have been
drinking some time, he brings wine that is poorer; but
you have kept your best wine until now!"</p>

</div>
<p>The only ones who knew whence the new wine had
come were the servants. But they soon told others, and
the word was passed around the company that Jesus of
Nazareth, Mary's son, had wrought this wonderful work.
His followers, the five or more disciples who had come
with Jesus to the wedding feast, now believed more fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
than before that their teacher was more than a mere
man, that the power of God was upon him and that
whatever he should say was the word of God.</p>

<p>Such a work as that of turning the water into wine,
a work that no man could do without God's power, was
called "a miracle." It showed that the one who wrought
it was a man sent from God, doing God's will and speaking
God's word. This was the first miracle or work of
wonder that Jesus wrought; but after this we shall read
of many miracles.</p>

<p>From the wedding feast Jesus went down the mountains
of Galilee to the city of Capernaum, which stood
on the shore of the Sea of Galilee on the northwest.
With Jesus on this visit to Capernaum were his mother,
some of his younger brothers and his followers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Lord in His Temple</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 19</div>


<div class='cap'>THE SPRING-TIME of the year came, when the
people from all parts of the land went up to Jerusalem
to attend the great feast of the Passover.</div>

<p>You remember that this feast was held to keep in
mind how more than a thousand years before God had
led the Israelite people out of Egypt, where they had
been slaves. It was called the feast of the Passover
because on the night of their going-out the angel of death
had "passed over" the houses of the Israelites when he
brought death to the Egyptian homes. On that night,
too, they went out of Egypt in such haste that the women
did not have time to wait for the bread to rise before
baking it, and all the bread eaten at that time was
"unleavened bread," or bread made without yeast.</p>

<p>To keep in mind that great day, the day when Israel
became a nation, ruling itself, in the spring of every year
all the people gathered in Jerusalem, and for one week
ate unleavened bread, that is, bread made without yeast.
Great services were held in the Temple on every day of
this feast; and on one evening a special dinner of a
roasted lamb was eaten by everybody, to keep in mind
the last meal which the Israelites ate in the land of
Egypt, with their hats on their heads and their cloaks
on their shoulders and their shoes on their feet, all ready
to march away.</p>

<p>Jesus and the little company of his disciples or
followers went up to Jerusalem, walking, as many times
before, down the Jordan valley to Jericho, and then
climbing the hills to the holy city. For many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Jesus had been coming to the feast of the Passover; but
never before had he come as he came now, in the power
of the Spirit, as the Son of God.</p>

<p>Around the House of God was a great open court,
called the Court of the Gentiles, where foreign people
who were not Jews came to pray; since none but Jews
or Israelites could enter the inner courts. But the Jews
held all Gentiles or foreign people in contempt. They
did not look upon the part of the Temple buildings where
foreigners prayed as holy; and they had turned this
court, the Court of the Gentiles, into a market place.
Here Jesus found everywhere sheep and oxen brought
there for sale; cages full of doves, which were sold to
the poorer people for offerings upon the altar; counters
where sat men changing the money of people from other
lands into the coins of Judea. There was nothing of the
quiet and peace which should be in a place of prayer;
all was noise and confusion; the lowing of oxen, the
voices of men buying and selling, the jingling of silver
on the tables.</p>

<p>These sights and sounds stirred the heart of Jesus.
He felt that such work as went on around him was unfit
and was wicked in a place set apart for the worship of
God. He picked up a piece of rope from the floor and
untwisted its cords until it seemed like a whip. Then
standing before the buyers and the sellers, he called
upon them to stop their trading. They looked up
amazed at this stranger whose face glowed with power
as though he were a king.</p>

<p>Alone, without help from anyone, he drove all these
people out of the court. He bade them lead away the
sheep and the oxen; he commanded those who sold the
doves to carry out their cages; he overturned the tables
of the money-changers and sent their silver rolling upon
the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus-141.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">Standing before the buyers and the sellers, he called upon them to stop their
trading; he overturned the tables of the money changers and sent
their silver rolling upon the floor.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>"Take all these things away," he cried out. "This
is the house of my Father; you shall not make it a house
for buying and selling."</p>

<p>Even the little company of his disciples&mdash;Peter,
John, Andrew and the others&mdash;stood still in wonder as
they saw their Master alone, armed only with a piece
of rope, driving out the gates this crowd of men, who
were frightened at the kingliness of his looks and
fled before him, not for one moment daring to resist
his will.</p>

<p>But soon came the priests and rulers of the Temple.
They ought not to have allowed these men to trade in the
Temple Court and to make it a market place. But some
of them took a share of the money that was made in
that place. One high priest, it is said, owned all the
cages of doves and pigeons that were kept in the Temple
for sale. These rulers were very angry to have the trading
stopped and their gains taken away.</p>

<p>"What right have you to come here," they said to
Jesus, "and make trouble? Who are you that you should
undertake to rule in this place? Show us some sign or
proof that you are Master here!"</p>

<p>"The time is coming," said Jesus, "when I will show
you a sign of my power, but not now; and when that
sign comes, you will not believe it."</p>

<p>Then, making a motion of his hands as though
pointing to himself, he added:</p>

<p>"Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise
it up."</p>

<p>The Jews were horrified at these words; for they
thought that he was speaking of the building on Mount
Moriah, and in their mind to speak of pulling down the
house where God dwelt was a terrible thing. But Jesus
was speaking of himself as the Son of God, in whose body
dwelt the Spirit of God. Far more than that building,<span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
where men cheated and did evil deeds, Jesus himself
was the house of God. The rulers said:</p>

<p>"This Temple has taken forty-six years to build, and
it is not finished yet; and will you raise it up in three
days?"</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years before, King Herod had begun to
rebuild the Temple, which in his time had become old and
decayed. The repairs were made very slowly, and in the
time of Jesus the building was still far from being finished.
It was not finished until more than twenty years
afterward.</p>

<p>We know what Jesus meant by those words; that
three years afterward, those very men would cause him,
the Son of God, whose body was God's dwelling place,
to be put to death; and within three days after his death
he would rise from his tomb, to be the Temple of God
again and forever. The disciples of Jesus heard these
words, but at that time did not know what they meant.</p>

<p>Jesus stayed for some time in Jerusalem and talked
to the people about the Kingdom of God. He also did
some wonderful works, such as curing the sick; and the
people who saw these acts believed his words, as from one
whom God had sent to men. But the priests and the
rulers hated Jesus, because he spoke against their wicked
lives, and they did all that they could to turn the people
away from him.</p>

<p>Among the rulers, however, were a few men who
listened to Jesus and believed his words. One of these
was a man named Nicodemus. He wished to have a
talk with Jesus and learn more of his teachings. But
he was afraid to be seen with Jesus in the day-time,
knowing that the other rulers were so strongly against
Jesus. So he went quietly one night, unknown to everybody,
and had a meeting with Jesus. Nicodemus began
by saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Teacher, we all know that you have been sent by
God to speak to us, because no one could do these wonderful
things that you are doing unless God were with
him to give him power."</p>

<p>Jesus said to him:</p>

<p>"Let me tell you and all your people one thing.
No man can have any part in the Kingdom of God unless
he is born again from God."</p>

<p>Nicodemus did not know what this meant, and he
said, "How can a man be born again after he is grown
up?"</p>

<p>"Every man," said Jesus, "must become a new
man and have the Spirit of God dwelling in him, if he
is to come into the Kingdom of God. Do not be surprised
that I say to you, 'You must be born anew.'
There are many things that you cannot understand.
Listen to the wind blowing! You can hear it, but you
cannot tell from what place it comes nor to what place
it goes. Just so is it with every one who is born of God's
spirit."</p>

<p>What Jesus meant in these words was that every
one who would be a follower of Christ needs to have a new
heart and to live a new life; and this new heart and new
life God alone can give to him.</p>

<p>One great sentence was spoken by Jesus at this
time. Here it is.</p>

<p>"God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,
that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but
have eternal life."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2>AT THE OLD WELL</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 20</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE Passover, Jesus went teaching through
the villages in Judea, the province or part of
the land around Jerusalem. As Judea was the
largest of the five provinces, it gave its name also to the
whole land, which was called both "Judea" and "the
land of Israel." John the Baptist was still preaching
and baptizing, although the crowds which now came to
hear him were not so great as before. While John was
near the Sea of Galilee, Jesus stayed in Judea, so that
none might think that he was trying to draw the people
away from John.</div>

<p>But after a time Jesus heard that John the Baptist
had been put in prison by Herod Antipas, the wicked
ruler of Galilee and Perea. Herod had stolen from his
brother Philip his wife, named Herodias, and was living
with her. John said to him:</p>

<p>"It is against the law of Moses and of God for you
to take away your brother's wife."</p>

<p>This made Herod angry with John, and Herodias
even more angry. She wished to have John put to death
for his bold words, but Herod, though he was not a good
man, was unwilling to have John slain, and partly to
keep him safe from the hate of his wife, he ordered that
he should be put into prison. To a man like John,
used to the free life of the wilderness, and not even
willing to live in town or village, it must have been
hard to be shut up in a prison cell, within four walls,
and to be able only to see the outside world through
grated windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Jesus learned that John the Baptist
was shut up in prison, he ended his work in Judea, and
with his disciples started for Galilee, his old home in the
north. On this journey he did not go the way of the
river Jordan, but took the most direct road, which would
lead him through the land of Samaria. He knew that the
Samaritan people who lived in that land hated the Jews
and often robbed them when they traveled through
their country. Still, Jesus made up his mind to go
through Samaria.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-147.jpg" width="500" height="395" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">John the Baptist rebuking Herod</span>
</div>

<p>Leading the little company of his followers, he
walked northward from Jerusalem, past Bethel, where
long before Jacob lying on his pillow of stone had his
wonderful dream of the ladder reaching up to heaven;
past Shiloh, where once the holy Ark of God had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kept in the Tabernacle in the days of Samuel; and over
mountains where battles had been fought and victories
won.</p>

<p>Early one morning, after walking in the night,
Jesus and his disciples came to an old well, about two
miles from the city of Shechem. Nearby was a little
village, named Sychar, which could be seen from the
well, and although it was a Samaritan village the followers
of Jesus went to it to buy some food. This well
was very old. It had been dug by Jacob, the early
father of all the Israelite people, more than eighteen
hundred years before Jesus came to that place. And it
is still there, a well dug out of the solid rock nearly one
hundred feet deep, and even now having water in it ten
months of the year, but apt to be dry in the summer.
That well is now nearly four thousand years old, yet
every traveler who visits it may look down into its
depths, may see a bucket of water drawn and may have
a drink from it.</p>

<p>In that time a well did not have with it a pump for
bringing up the water, nor was there even a rope to let
down into it; but each one who came to draw water&mdash;and
it was generally a woman&mdash;brought a rope and a
water-jar. As Jesus sat beside the well, very tired and
hungry and thirsty, he had nothing with which to draw
water. As the Son of God upon the earth, he
could have made the water come to him, but he would
not, for you remember that in the desert Jesus would
do no wonderful work, no miracle, merely for his own
need.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jesus heard the sound of someone coming.
He looked up and saw a woman, with her water-jar
and rope, standing by the well. From her dress he
knew that she was not a Jewish but a Samaritan woman,
and being the Son of God, he saw more. He knew at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
once all her life, which had not been a good life. But
he looked into her heart and saw that she had a longing
after God and after good. He said to her:</p>

<p>"Will you give me a drink of water from this well?"</p>

<p>The woman glanced at Jesus, and knowing from
his dress and his manner of speaking that he was a
Jew, said to him:</p>

<p>"How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask drink from
me, a Samaritan woman?"</p>

<p>The Jews looked down upon the Samaritans, never
asked any favors of them, and would not drink from a
cup or pitcher that a Samaritan had handled. The
woman knew this, and was greatly surprised that this
strange young man of the Jewish race should speak to
her. Jesus answered her:</p>

<p>"If you knew what God's free gift is, and who he is
that is asking you for a drink, you would have asked
him instead, and he would have given you living water."</p>

<p>As Jesus said these words, very thoughtfully, the
woman looking and listening felt that this was no common
man. She thought that he might be a prophet, a
man whom God had sent to do mighty works and speak
the words of God. She said, very respectfully:</p>

<p>"Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the
well is very deep. Where can you get your living water?
Are you a greater man than our father Jacob, who dug
this well and gave it to us, and drank of its water himself,
with his sons and his sheep and oxen?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered her:</p>

<p>"Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty
again, but anyone who drinks the water that I will give
him will never thirst any more. The water that I will
give him will turn into a well of water springing up to
everlasting life."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said the woman, "give me some of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
living water, so that I need not be thirsty nor come all
this road to draw water."</p>

<p>Jesus looked earnestly at the woman's face, and
then said to her:</p>

<p>"Go home; call your husband, and come here
again."</p>

<p>The woman's face clouded, her eyes dropped, and
she looked as if she felt ashamed, while she answered in
a low voice, "I have no husband."</p>

<p>Jesus looked at her steadily, and said:</p>

<p>"You have spoken the truth. You have no husband.
But you have had five husbands, and the man
with whom you are living now is not your husband.
You spoke the truth in those words."</p>

<p>The woman was filled with wonder as she heard the
stranger speak. She saw at once that here was a man
who knew everything. She was sure that God had
spoken to this man and given him this knowledge of her.
"Sir," said she, "I see that you are a prophet of God.
Tell me, then, whether our people or the Jews are right.
Our fathers have worshipped God on this mountain;
but the Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where all
should go to worship God."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she pointed to the mountain that was
standing near, Mount Gerizim, on the top of which was
the temple of the Samaritans.</p>

<p>"Woman, believe me," answered Jesus, "there is
coming a time when men shall worship God in other
places besides this mountain and Jerusalem. The time
is near, it has even now come, when the true worshippers
everywhere shall pray to the Father in spirit and in
truth. God is a Spirit, dwelling everywhere, and those
who worship him, must worship in spirit and in truth."</p>

<img src="images/illus-151.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="Painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus sat beside the well, very tired and thirsty, but he had nothing with which
to draw water. Suddenly he heard the sound of someone coming, and
looking up saw a Samaritan woman with her water jar.</span>
</div>

<p>The woman said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"I know that Messiah is coming, the Christ sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
from God to be our King. When he comes he will
explain everything to us."</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to her, "I who am now speaking to
you am he, the Christ!"</p>

<p>Just at that moment the followers of Jesus, John
and Peter, and the others, came back from the village
with the food which they had bought. They were surprised
to find their Master talking with a woman, but
they said nothing.</p>

<p>The woman had come to the well to draw water,
but in her interest in this wonderful stranger she forgot
all about her errand. Leaving her water-jar she ran
back to the village and said to everybody whom she met:</p>

<p>"Come with me and meet a man who told me everything
I have done in all my life! Is not this man the
Christ whom we are looking for?"</p>

<p>After the woman went away toward her home, the
disciples urged Jesus to eat some of the food which they
had brought. A little while before Jesus had been
hungry, but now in talking with the woman and leading
her mind to the truth, he had forgotten his own needs.</p>

<p>"I have food to eat," said he, "that you know
nothing of."</p>

<p>They looked at each other and said:</p>

<p>"Can it be that someone has brought him something
to eat?"</p>

<p>But Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will
of my Father who sent me into the world, and to finish
the work that he gave me to do. Do you say that there
are four months before the harvest time will come?
I tell you to look on the fields, and find them already
white for the harvest. You shall reap and gain a rich
harvest, gathering grain for everlasting life."</p>

<p>Jesus meant that this woman, bad though she may
have been before, was now eager to hear his words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to come to God. So his disciples would soon find the
hearts of men everywhere, like a field of ripe grain,
ready to be won and to be saved.</p>

<p>Soon the woman came back to the well with many
of her people. They all asked Jesus to come to their
village and teach them. He went to the town of Sychar
and stayed there two days, talking to the people about
the Kingdom of God and showing them how they might
enter into it. Many of the people in that place and near
it believed in Jesus as the Christ, the King sent from
God, and they said:</p>

<p>"Now we have heard for ourselves and we know
that this is really the Saviour of the world."</p>

<h2>THE NOBLEMAN'S BOY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 21</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-155.jpg" width="500" height="414" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Jacob&#39;s well as it is at the present time</span>
</div>


<p>AFTER STAYING two days in Sychar, the village
near Jacob's well, Jesus and his disciples went on
their way northward to the land of Galilee. They
walked across the great plain where so many battles had
been fought in the old times, and climbed the mountains
beyond it. Nazareth, where Jesus had lived for so
many years, was on his way, but Jesus did not at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
time stop there, for he had in his mind to visit it a few
weeks later. With his followers, Jesus came for the
second time to Cana, the place where a few months
before he had turned the water into wine.</p>

<p>When Jesus was at Cana at his first visit, very few
people had heard his name. But now everybody was
talking about him,
for all the people
who had come home
from the Feast of
the Passover told
their friends and
neighbors of the
wonderful young
Prophet who had
been preaching in
Jerusalem, and had
driven the men buying
and selling out
of the Temple, and
had wrought wonders
in curing the
sick.</p>

<p>About twenty
miles from Cana was
the city of Capernaum,
on the shore
of the Sea of Galilee. At Capernaum was living a man of
high rank, an official of King Herod Antipas. This
nobleman was in deep trouble, for his son was very ill
with a great fever and lying at the point of death. The
news that Jesus was again in Galilee, and only twenty
miles away, brought to the nobleman a hope that
perhaps this Prophet might be willing to come down
from Cana to Capernaum and cure his son.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">

<span class="caption">In the court of a village home in Cana of Galilee</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>At once he made up his mind to go to Jesus and ask
him to come and help him. It was a hard journey from
Capernaum to Cana, twenty miles of mountain climbing;
but this anxious father started very early in the
morning, and came to Cana at about one o'clock in the
afternoon. He found Jesus, told him how ill his son
was, and begged him to come to Capernaum and cure
him. Jesus did not seem very willing to go. He said
to the nobleman:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-157.jpg" width="500" height="270" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Site of Capernaum</span>
</div>

<p>"Unless you people are always seeing me do wonderful
works you will not believe in me."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," pleaded the troubled father, "do come
down quickly or my son will die!"</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to come," said Jesus.
"You may go home, for your son will live and will get
well."</p>

<p>These words would make a heavy trial to this man's
faith in Jesus. For how could he know that his son
would be well, without any sign given him by Jesus?
And how could he understand that Jesus by a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could cure someone who he had not seen and who was
twenty miles away? But the father at once believed
the promise of Jesus. He did not even hurry home to
see if his boy was cured, but waited until evening before
starting upon his journey.</p>

<p>The next day, as he was nearing home, his servants
met him with the glad news:</p>

<p>"Your son is living and is very much better."</p>

<p>"At what time," said the nobleman, "did he begin
to improve?"</p>

<p>"It was yesterday," they told him, "at about one
o'clock when the fever left him."</p>

<p>The man was not surprised, for it was just as he
had expected. That hour, one o'clock, was the very
time that Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live."</p>

<p>This miracle, or work of wonder, was much talked
about and led not only this nobleman, but all his family
with him, to believe that Jesus was the Saviour and the
King of Israel who had been promised so long.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Carpenter in His Home-town</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 22</div>


<div class='cap'>SOON AFTER the visit to Cana, and the cure of the
nobleman's son, Jesus walked over to his old home
at Nazareth, which was only six miles away. He
thought of his sisters in that city, who were now grown
women with children of their own, and he longed to see
them. He thought, too, of the boys with whom in
other days he had played and had sat in the school, now
men with families; of his former neighbors, whom he
had not seen for nearly a year. His heart was full of
love for his own people, and he felt that out of the power
God had given him he could speak to them words that
would do them good.</div>

<p>Of course, the people of Nazareth had heard wonderful
stories about their former townsman; that he had
suddenly come forth as a great teacher, speaking truths
such as never had been heard before; and especially,
that he had done wondrous works of curing the sick at
Cana and at Capernaum. All these reports were surprising
to the people of Nazareth, because among them
Jesus had never shown any signs of greatness. He had
sat in his seat in the church, but had never spoken from
the pulpit; and they had known him as a good young
man, kind and gentle toward all, and an honest, skilful
workman at his trade. But they had never thought of
him as a teacher, or a prophet bearing a message from
God, or as a worker of wonders, such as they had heard
of his doing in Cana and Capernaum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus-160.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The people in the synagogue at Nazareth did not care for the words of Jesus.
In their rage and fury they leaped from their seats and
dragged him out of doors.</span>
</div>

<p>It was expected that Jesus on the Sabbath day
would speak in the church at Nazareth (they called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
their church "the synagogue," a word that means "a
meeting of the people"); and everybody was present to
see him and to hear him. In a gallery on one side were
his sisters, looking and listening, but unseen, because
the women's gallery in all Jewish churches was covered
with a lattice-work. There on the floor, seated on rugs
or mats, were his neighbors and the people who had seen
him grow up from a boy to a man. They were present,
not to learn, but to listen and judge his words, and
especially to see what great things he might do.</p>

<p>Jesus walked up to the platform, and the officer in
charge handed him the rolls on which were written the
lessons for the day. This officer was at the same time
the janitor or keeper of the building and the teacher of
the school held there during the week. This man may
have been the teacher who had taught Jesus as a boy to
read. One of the lessons for that day was in the sixty-first
chapter of the book of Isaiah the prophet. A part
of it read thus:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Because he hath set me apart to preach the gospel to the poor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He has sent me to say that the prisoners shall be set free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That the blind shall have their sight again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That the poor and suffering shall be given freedom,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That the time of favor from God has come."</span><br />
</div>

<p>While Jesus was reading from the Bible, he stood
up, and all who were present also stood, for the Jews
showed their respect for the Bible by standing whenever
it was read. When he had finished the reading, he
folded up the roll, handed it back to the officer, and sat
down, and the people also sat down likewise. Often the
man who preached in the synagogue or church was seated
while speaking. Jesus began by saying:</p>

<p>"Today this word of the prophet has come to pass
in your hearing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>And he went on to tell in simple, gentle words how
he had been sent to preach to the poor, to set the
prisoners free, to give sight to the blind and to bring the
news of God's goodness to men. At first the people
listened with the deepest interest, and their hearts were
touched by his kind and tender words.</p>

<p>But soon they began to whisper among themselves.
One said, "Why should this carpenter try to teach us?"
And another, "This man is no teacher! He is only the
son of Joseph the carpenter! We know his brothers, and
his sisters are living here." And some began to say,
"Why does he not do here some of the wonderful things
that they say he has done in other places? We want to
see some of his marvelous cures with sick people!"</p>

<p>Jesus knew their thoughts, but he would not do
wonders merely to be seen by men. He said to them:</p>

<p>"I know that you are saying, 'Let us see some
wonderful work, like that on the nobleman's son in
Capernaum.' I tell you in truth, that no prophet or
teacher has honor among his own people.</p>

<p>"You remember that in the days of Elijah the prophet,
when the sky was shut up for three years and six months,
and no rain fell, there was a great famine in the land and
a need of bread. At that time there were many widows
in the land of Israel, yet Elijah was not sent to any of
these, but to a widow woman in Zarephath of Zidon, a
foreigner and a Gentile. And in the time of Elisha the
prophet after Elijah, there were many lepers in the land
of Israel, yet none of these was made clean of his leprosy,
but only Naaman the Syrian."</p>

<p>These words, telling how God had chosen foreigners
instead of Israelites for his works of wonder, made the
people in the church very angry, for they did not care for
the words of Jesus; they only wished to see him do
some miracle or wonderful act. They would not listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to him; in their rage and fury, they leaped from their
seats; they rushed upon the platform; they seized hold
of Jesus and dragged him out of doors. They took him
up to the top of the hill above the city, and would have
thrown him down its steep side to his death. But the
time for Jesus to die had not yet come. By the power
of God, Jesus slipped quietly out of their hands and
went away. He walked away very sadly from Nazareth,
for he had longed to bring the good news of God's blessings
first of all to his own people.</p>

<h2>Four Fishermen Called</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 23</div>


<div class='cap'>THE PLACE which Jesus chose for his home, after
being driven away from Nazareth, was Capernaum.
This was a large city on the northwestern
shore of the Sea of Galilee. Only one city beside the
lake was larger&mdash;Tiberias. That was a new city, built
by Herod, the ruler of Galilee, and named after the
Emperor Tiberius at Rome. But Tiberias was not a
Jewish city. It contained temples to idols, its people
were foreigners, and very few Jews were willing to live
within its walls. Then, too, Herod Antipas lived there
in a palace which he had built, and Jesus did not wish
to be near Herod.</div>

<p>But Capernaum was a Jewish city, and Jesus felt
that his work was to be among the Jews. At least four
of the early followers of Jesus lived in Capernaum; two
pair of brothers, Simon and Andrew, the sons of Jonas;
and James and John, the sons of Zebedee. These four
men were partners with Zebedee in the fishing trade.
They owned a number of fishing boats and had men
working for them. The lake was full of fish, and many
people all around it lived by fishing. The fish in the
Sea of Galilee were good food, and were sent to all the
nearby cities. It is said that one emperor at Rome, not
long after this time, had sent to him every week a barrel
full of fish from the Sea of Galilee, for his table in the
palace.</p>

<p>The people of Capernaum had heard of Jesus, for all
those who went up to the feasts in Jerusalem brought
home reports of this wonderful teacher and healer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sick. Wherever Jesus went, crowds gathered around
him to listen to his words, and especially eager to see if
he would do any of his wonderful works.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">
<a href="images/illus-166-big.png"><img src="images/illus-166.png" width="322" height="400" alt="map" /></a>
<span class="caption">LOWER GALILEE</span>
</div>

<p>One morning while Jesus was walking on the beach,
he met some of his followers. Having now come to their
own home, these men had gone back to their old work,
as fishermen, and their boats were lying upon the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The men had been fishing in the night before, and they
were now washing their nets upon the beach. Jesus
spoke to one of his followers, Simon Peter, to push his
boat a little way out into the water. He did so, and
then Jesus sat down in the boat, while a great crowd
stood on the shore, but within reach of his voice. Then
from the boat as a pulpit he talked to the people on the
shore. What he said at that time was not written
down; but it was very much like his teachings as given
in the Sermon on the Mount, which may be read in the
fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of the gospel by
Matthew. There is no doubt that in his talks in many
places to different crowds, Jesus often gave the same
teachings over and over again.</p>

<p>After Jesus had ended his speaking to the people,
he said to Simon, who with the other fishermen was
standing beside him:</p>

<p>"Push out into the deep water, and let down your
nets for a catch of fish."</p>

<p>"Master," answered Simon, "we worked all last
night and caught not a single fish. However, if you tell
us to try again, I will let down the nets."</p>

<p>They did so, and now their nets took in a great
shoal of fish, so large a number that the nets began to
break. Then they beckoned to their partners in the
other boat to come and help them. They came, and
helped to pull up the nets and to empty the fish into
the boats. So many were the fish that they filled both
the boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon
Peter saw all this, he was struck with wonder and with
fear, for he felt that this had been done by the power
of God. He fell upon his knees in the boat to Jesus,
saying:</p>

<p>"O Lord, I am full of sin, and am not worthy of all
this! Leave me, O Lord!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jesus said to him and to the other three men
with him:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid; come after me; and from this
time you shall be fishers of men."</p>

<p>He meant that they were now to leave their nets
and their boats, to stay with him; and after learning
from him, they were to go out and show men the way
out of sin into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>As soon, therefore, as they had brought their nets
and their fishes to the land, they left them with Zebedee,
the father of James and John, and with the hired men.</p>

<p>From that day these four men stayed with Jesus
and went with him on all his journeys, listening to his
words, until from hearing them often, they learned them
and could repeat them to others.</p>

<h2>Jesus in the Church, in the House,
and in the Street</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 24</div>


<div class='cap'>THE STORY of the great catch of fish was told
abroad, for many saw the boats loaded with the
fish brought to the shore, and we may be sure
that all who ate a breakfast of those fish spoke of the
wonder. Partly as a result of this report, when the
Sabbath day came, the church in Capernaum was
crowded with people to see and hear this new Rabbi.
"Rabbi" was the name that Jews gave to men who
taught the law in their churches. Although Jesus had
never taken the course of study at Jerusalem which
would give him that title, he was generally called
"Rabbi" by the people. The people listened with
wonder to the words of Jesus, for his teaching was very
different from that of the scribes who taught the law.
He spoke on great things&mdash;the kingdom which God was
soon to set up, and how the people were to be made
ready for his coming. Then, too, he spoke with power,
as Lord of all; and the listeners felt that these were the
words of one who had been sent by God.</div>


<p>While Jesus was speaking in the church, the service
was stopped by the loud screaming of a furious man who
had come in. This man was suffering with a terrible
evil, worse than any disease. Into his body had come
in some way an evil spirit, a demon. This demon controlled
the man and drove him to wild acts and words.
The words which were spoken by this man's tongue were
not his own, but the words of the wicked spirit within
him. The spirit, using the man's voice, shrieked aloud:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/illus-172.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">From all parts of the city of Capernaum they brought those that were sick, or
had evil spirits, and Jesus healed them all.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>"Ha, you Jesus of Nazareth, let us alone! What
business have you with us? Have you come to destroy
us? I know who you are; you are God's Holy One!"</p>

<p>But Jesus at once said to the wicked spirit in the
man, "Be still, and come out of him!"</p>

<p>At these words the demon threw the man down
upon the floor, as if to kill him; and then went out of
the man suddenly, leaving him almost dead. Soon
they found that the man, whom everybody had feared
before, so fierce had he been, was now perfectly well and
quite free from the evil spirit.</p>

<p>Then surprise and wonder came upon all. They
talked about it to one another, saying:</p>

<p>"What does all this mean? What new teaching is
this? Why, this man speaks to the evil spirits with
power, and they obey him and come out."</p>

<p>As the people left the church they told everyone
whom they met of this mighty act of Jesus. These men
and women told others, and soon the news of Jesus'
power went through all the towns and villages in that
part of the land.</p>

<p>After the service in the church was over, Jesus went
home to dine in the house of Simon and Andrew, and
with him went also the two brothers, James and John.
In the house they told him that Simon's mother-in-law,
the mother of his wife, was very ill, having a high fever.
He came, stood by her bed, leaned over her and took
her by the hand as if to raise her up. As he touched
her, she felt a new power shoot through her body.
Instantly the fever left her; she rose up from her bed,
perfectly well, and helped to make ready the dinner
and serve it.</p>

<p>Jesus stayed in Simon's house that afternoon.
When the sun went down and the Sabbath was ended,
they found a crowd of people filling the street in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the house. From all parts of the city they had
brought people that were sick, or had evil spirits, like
the man whom Jesus had cured in the church. As he
came out of the house he laid his hands upon these sick
people, one by one; and as soon as he touched them,
they rose up well. The evil spirits in some of the men
tried to speak to him. But he would not allow them,
and gave them command at once to come out of the men
in whom they were. They dared not to disobey Jesus,
came out and went away.</p>

<p>On that night, while everybody was sleeping, Jesus
rose up long before day, while it was still dark, and went
out of the city. He found a quiet place, with no houses
or people near, and there for hours he prayed to his
Father. In the morning he was missed, and Simon
Peter, with the others, went out to look for him. They
found him and said to him, "Master, come back to the
city, for everybody is looking for you!"</p>

<p>But Jesus said, "I was sent not only to your city
but to other places also. Let us go out and visit the
towns that are near. It was for this purpose that I
have been sent by my Father, to preach everywhere the
good news of the Kingdom of God."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Leper and the Palsied Man</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 25</div>


<div class='cap'>FROM THE city of Capernaum Jesus went forth
and visited all the villages on the western shore of
the Sea of Galilee and on the mountains near by.
He took with him his disciples or followers, that they
might see his works and listen to his words. Great
crowds of people came to hear him during this journey;
and everywhere he cured all kinds of sickness and cast
out of men evil spirits that were ruling them.</div>

<p>At one place a man came to Jesus who was covered
with a dreadful disease called leprosy and was called
"a leper." No one ever touched a leper or even came
near him, for they feared that a touch might cause the
disease. A leper was driven out of the home, to live with
other lepers in a camp outside the city. When he saw
anyone coming near, he must stand at a distance, must
cover his mouth with his garment, not to let his breath
reach anybody, and must call out, "Unclean! Unclean!"
so that no one might take his disease. Many lepers were
in the land when Jesus was preaching; and lepers may
still be seen in that country.</p>

<p>This leper who saw Jesus came as near to him as he
dared. He knelt down before Jesus, touching his head
to the ground, and called out to him:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if you choose to do it, you can take away
my leprosy, and make my flesh pure and clean."</p>

<p>Jesus was not afraid to touch the leper. He went
to him and placed his hand upon him. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I do choose; be clean!"</p>

<p>And at once all this man's leprosy passed way. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
skin lost its waxen, deadly whiteness, his eyes were
bright, his deformed hands became perfect and his voice
was no longer hollow and cracked. He was no more a
leper, but was a man in perfect health.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone of your cure;
but go to the priest in the temple, let him see that you
are clean, and make the offering of thanksgiving to God.
Let the priest give you a writing to show that you are
well, and then go to your own home."</p>

<p>Jesus knew that if this man should tell very many
of his cure, there would come such a crowd of people
having diseases of all kinds, seeking to be made well,
that he could have no time nor chance to preach the
gospel, and his great purpose was, not to cure diseases,
but to teach men the way to God. It is better to be
saved from sin than to be cured of sickness.</p>

<p>But this man was so happy at being made well that
he could not be still. Everywhere he went he told
people of his wonderful cure, and roused such a desire
among the people to see Jesus that Jesus could not go
to the cities, for so great were the crowds that he could
no longer preach. Everybody was eager to be cured of
some illness or to see Jesus cure others. Jesus was
driven to seek the open country, where few people
lived, and even there the crowds sought him, coming
from many places.</p>

<span class="caption">They broke open the roof and let the man down, wrapped in a blanket and lying
upon a mattress, right in front of Jesus.</span>
</div>

<p>After some time, Jesus came again to Capernaum,
which was now his home. As soon as the people heard
of his return, they gathered in great crowds to see him,
to hear him and to be cured of their diseases. He stood
on the porch of a house, where every room was full of
people, and a company was in front of him, crowding
the court of the house to its utmost corner. In this
throng were some who were ready to believe in Jesus;
but there were also some men who had come from Judea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to see who Jesus was, what he was teaching and what he
was doing. These men did not believe in Jesus, but
were there to find some fault with him. They belonged
to a class called "the Pharisees," who claimed to be
better than others, because they carefully kept all the
rules of the Jewish law; but in their hearts they were
far from good, and they were bitterly opposed to Jesus.</p>

<p>While Jesus was speaking, four men came, carrying
on a bed a man who was sick with the palsy, a disease
which makes one helpless, unable to use his hands, to
walk or to stand alone. They were very eager to bring
this man to Jesus to be cured, but on account of the
crowd they could not come into the house or even into
the yard in front of it. They were bound, however, in
some way to get this palsied man to Jesus. They
climbed up to the roof of the house and pulled the sick
man up. Then they broke open the roof, never minding
the dust and litter that fell upon the heads of the
people below. When they had made an opening large
enough, they let the man down, wrapped in a blanket
and lying upon a mattress, right in front of Jesus. All
this showed their faith in Jesus. They believed that he
could cure the palsied man, and were ready to take any
trouble to bring him before the Saviour.</p>

<p>Jesus looked at the man, and said to him:</p>

<p>"My son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven!"</p>

<p>Some of these Pharisees, the enemies of Jesus, were
sitting near, and as they heard these words they thought
in their own minds, though they did not speak it aloud:</p>

<p>"What wicked words are these! This man speaks
as though he were God! No man has the right to forgive
sins; that belongs to God alone. What wickedness,
for this man to pretend to have God's power!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/illus-179.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The leper knelt down before Jesus and called out to him: &quot;Oh, sir, if you
choose you can make my flesh pure and clean.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus knew their thoughts, for he could look into
their hearts. He said to them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you think wicked things in your hearts?
Which is the easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or
to say, 'Rise up and walk'? But I will show you that
while I am on earth as the Son of Man, God has given
me the power to take away sin."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the palsied man lying on the
couch, and said with a voice of power:</p>

<p>"I tell you, rise up, take up your bed, and go to
your house!"</p>

<p>In an instant a new life came to the palsied man.
He stood upon his feet in full strength, rolled up his
blanket, took up the mattress upon which he had been
lying, placed it upon his shoulder and walked out through
the crowd, which opened to make a way for him. Through
the streets the man went to his home, praising God for
his cure.</p>

<p>By this act of healing Jesus had shown that he was
the Son of God, with the right to forgive the sins of men.
These Pharisees, the enemies of Jesus, could find nothing
to say, but in their hearts they hated him more than
before, for they saw that the people believed on Jesus.
Wonder filled the minds of those who saw this cure;
they praised the God of Israel and said to each other,
"We have seen strange things today!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<h2>How the Tax-Collector Became a
Disciple</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 26</div>


<div class='cap'>SO GREAT were the crowds gathering from all parts
of the land to see and hear Jesus, that no place could
be found in the city of Capernaum large enough to
hold the multitudes. The church was far too small;
and there were no open places in the city where so great
a company could meet. So every day Jesus went out
of the city to the seaside, sometimes sitting in Peter's
boat, sometimes upon the shore, while all the people
stood upon the grass-covered hillside, with the blue sky
above them and the blue lake before them, while Jesus
spoke about the Kingdom of God and showed how every
man could enter into the kingdom by turning from his
sins and doing God's will.</div>

<p>Among these crowds of people Jesus noticed one man
standing, who listened closely to every word. This man
was named Levi-Matthew. He was an officer of the
government, called "a publican"; and it was his work to
gather the taxes which the Roman rulers had laid upon
the people. Everybody was called upon to pay money
to the Romans, who were the rulers of the land. The
people hated the Romans, who held the land under their
power, and hated also these tax-gatherers, who were
often selfish and unjust men, making the people pay
more than they should, robbing the poor and taking
much of the money for themselves instead of paying it
to the Roman treasury. Because many of these tax-gatherers
or publicans were cruel and selfish, all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were looked upon as wicked. They were called "publicans
and sinners," and the people despised them.</p>

<p>One day Jesus was passing the office where Levi-Matthew
sat at his table receiving the tax-money from
the people. Jesus looked at the publican and said to
him, "Come, follow me!" At once Levi-Matthew rose
up, left his clerks and helpers to care for the money on
the table, and went after Jesus. From that hour he was
no longer a tax-collector; he became a disciple of Jesus,
and followed him wherever he went, listening to his
words and keeping them in his mind and memory.
Many years afterward, when Jesus was no longer among
men, Matthew wrote a book telling of what Jesus said
and did. That book is the Gospel according to Matthew,
the first book in the New Testament; and it tells what
Matthew remembered of the teachings and acts of the
Lord Jesus. So it was well for the people who lived after
the time of Jesus, and for all the people who through the
ages since have read that gospel, and for the millions all
over the world who now read it, that Matthew the tax-gatherer
became a disciple of Jesus. But for this man's
prompt obedience to Christ's call on that day, that
precious book would never have been written.</p>

<p>Matthew wished his fellow-publicans to meet Jesus
and hear his words. He gave a supper at his house to
Jesus, and invited all the publicans or tax-gatherers in
that part of the country to come. Many of them came,
and with their friends sat down to the supper with Jesus.
The Pharisees, who were enemies of Jesus, looked scornfully
at Jesus sitting at the table with all the tax-gatherers
around him. They said to the disciples of Jesus:</p>

<p>"Why does your Teacher eat with those publicans
and sinners?"</p>

<p>They told Jesus of these words, and he answered:</p>

<p>"Those who are well and strong have no need of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
doctor, but only those who are sick. I did not come to
call those who think themselves good, but those who
know that they are sinful and want to be saved. But let
those Pharisees learn the meaning of the text where God
says, 'I prefer those who show kindness and mercy, to
those who offer sacrifices upon the altar.'"</p>

<p>This pointed to the Pharisees themselves, for while
they were careful about fasting and saying their prayers
and making their offerings in the Temple, they were
often unjust and hard toward the poor.</p>

<h2>The Cripple at the Bath</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 27</div>


<div class='cap'>THE TIME came for another feast at Jerusalem, and
as on the year before, Jesus went to attend it.
We do not know whether his disciples were with
him on this visit, for in the story as given by John in his
gospel, they are not mentioned.</div>

<p>On one Sabbath day, while Jesus was in the city, he
walked past a public bath not far from the Temple. It
was a large pool or cistern, where several could bathe at
once; and beside it were five porches, forming an arched-over
platform. These porches, when Jesus came to the
pool, were crowded with people, all suffering with disease.
Some were blind, some were lame and some had legs or
arms all withered and palsied.</p>

<p>At certain times the water in this bath used to bubble
and rise up; then it would go down again and be quiet.
The people believed that this bubbling up of the water
was caused by an angel (whom no one could see) going
down and stirring up the pool. They believed, too, that
at such times when the water bubbled up, any person
who was ill would be cured by taking a bath in the pool.
We know that there are many springs whose water will
cure diseases, and this pool may have been one of these
health-giving springs.</p>

<p>Jesus saw lying there upon a mat beside the bath
one man who had been helpless, unable to walk for
almost forty years. Jesus who knew all things, knew
that this man had been ill for a long time. He said to
him:</p>

<p>"Would you like to be made well?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>This man had never seen Jesus before and did not
know who he was.</p>

<p>"Sir," he answered, "there is nobody to put me in
the bath when the water rises; but while I am trying to
crawl down and get into the water, somebody who can
walk steps in ahead of me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-188.jpg" width="500" height="506" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Pool of Bethesda from above</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus said:</p>

<p>"Rise, take up your mat, and walk!"</p>

<p>The crippled man had never heard words like these;
but as soon as they were spoken, he felt a new power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
shooting through his body. He stood up for the first
time in thirty-eight years, picked up his piece of matting,
rolled it up and put it upon his shoulder. Then he
started to walk toward his house, carrying his burden.</p>

<p>You remember that it was on the Sabbath day that
this took place. The Jews were exceedingly careful in
keeping the Sabbath. God had said to their fathers
many years before, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep
it holy." But the Jews had added to this commandment
many useless rules. They could not light a fire on that
day, for that would be working; they could not hold a
pen, for that would be carrying a load. These little
rules had not been given by God, but had been made by
the scribes or teachers of the law.</p>

<p>Some people saw this man carrying his roll of matting
through the street. They said to him:</p>

<p>"Stop! don't you know this is the Sabbath day?
You have no right to be carrying your bed."</p>

<p>The man did not lay down his load. He said, "A
man saw me helpless by the pool, for I was nearly forty
years a cripple. This man made me well; and he it
was who said to me, 'Take up your mat and walk.'"</p>

<p>"Who was this man," said the Jews, "who told you
to carry your bed on the Sabbath day?"</p>

<p>The man who had been cured did not know who it
was that had cured him, for many were standing near,
and after healing the man Jesus had walked away without
being noticed. Soon after, the man went up to the
Temple to give thanks to God for his cure, and there he
met his healer and learned for the first time his name.
Jesus said to him at that time:</p>

<p>"You are now free from the disease which for so
many years has made you helpless. Do not sin any more
against God, or something worse will come to you."</p>

<p>The man went away and told the Jews that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Jesus who had cured him. The leaders among the Jews,
the priests, the scribes and the Pharisees, were very angry
at Jesus, because he had made this man well on the
Sabbath and because he had told the man to carry his
mat on that day. The rulers tried to stir up the people
against Jesus, saying that he was a Sabbath-breaker, and
nobody should listen to his words.</p>

<p>But Jesus said to them, "My Father works on all
days doing good to men; and I do only what he does."</p>

<p>He meant to show them that God sends his sunshine
and his rain every day in the week, causing the grass and
the grain and the flowers to grow as much on the Sabbath
as on other days; and that it was right for him and for
every man to do good works, helping men and curing
their sickness, on the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>But his words only made the Jews all the more
angry, because he had spoken of God as his Father,
making himself (they said) equal with God. They would
have killed him if they could, so great was their hate
against him.</p>

<p>Jesus did not stay long in Jerusalem at this visit.
Soon after the feast he went again to his home at Capernaum.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Lord of the Sabbath</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 28</div>


<div class='cap'>THE QUESTION whether Jesus was a Sabbath-breaker
or not, arose again soon after he came back
to Galilee. On a Sabbath day Jesus was walking
with his disciples through the fields of grain. Some of
the disciples were hungry, and as they walked picked the
heads of the wheat, rubbed them in their hands, blew
away the chaff and ate the kernels of grain. The law of
the Israelites allowed anyone walking by a field of grain
to help himself to all that he wished to eat, but forbade
him to take any to his home.</div>

<p>But to the Pharisees, who were very exact in their
rules of keeping the Sabbath, to pluck the grain was the
same as reaping it with a sickle, to carry it in the hand
was the same as bearing a load, and to rub it in the hands
was the same as thrashing; and to do these on the seventh
day of the week was breaking the Sabbath. These were
rules, not given by God, but made by the scribes; and
Jesus had already taught his disciples to pay no attention
to them.</p>

<p>The Pharisees were constantly watching Jesus and
his followers, to catch them, if possible, in doing or saying
something that might be thought wrong. They said to
Jesus:</p>

<p>"Do you see that your disciples are doing what is
forbidden on the Sabbath day; picking the ears of grain,
carrying handfuls of them and rubbing them in their
hands?"</p>

<p>"Have you never read," answered Jesus, "what
David did when he was flying from King Saul; how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
went into the house of God and took away the holy
bread, laid on the table as an offering to God, which was
to be eaten by the priests only; ate it himself and gave
it to the men that were with him? And do you not know
that the priests in the Temple do all kinds of work,
killing animals for the offering, placing wood on the altar
and many other things; yet they do right, for these
things are necessary, and whatever is needful may be
done on God's holy day. The Sabbath was made for
the good of man and not man for the Sabbath. I tell
you that One greater than the Temple is here, for the
Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</p>

<img src="images/illus-192.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus and His Disciples in the field of grain</span>
</div>

<p>On another Sabbath day Jesus went into the church
to worship God and to preach the word. A man was there
whose hand was withered and helpless. The Pharisees
watched Jesus to see if he would cure this man on the
Sabbath. They hoped he would cure him, not because
they cared for the poor, crippled man, but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they were eager to find something to say against
Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus spoke to the man with the withered hand,
"Stand up and come forward." The man stood up before
them all; and then Jesus, looking straight at his enemies,
said:</p>

<p>"Is it against
the law on the
Sabbath day to do
good or to do harm;
to save a life, or to
try to kill a man, as
you are trying to
do? If one of you
men owns a single
sheep, and he should
happen on the Sabbath
day to find it
fallen into a pit,
would he not take
hold of it and lift it
out? And how
much more is a man
worth than a sheep?
Thus it is right to
do a kind and helpful
act on the
Sabbath."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/illus-193.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The man with the withered hand healed by Jesus
in the church</span>
</div>

<p>He looked around sternly at his enemies, being sad
and grieved because their hearts were so hard. They
did not have a word to say; and after waiting a moment
he turned to the man with the withered hand and said:</p>

<p>"Stretch out your hand!"</p>

<p>He reached out his arm, and the withered hand was
at once made well and strong, as sound as the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Jesus went away, but the Pharisees were filled with anger
against him. They talked together, seeking some way
to kill Jesus; and they called upon the friends of King
Herod, the ruler of Galilee, to see if they could not persuade
the king to order that Jesus should be put to death.</p>

<p>But Jesus went on teaching and curing those that
were sick, paying no attention to the plans of his enemies.
He told those whom he cured, not to go out and speak
to others about him, but to stay quietly at home; for the
crowds coming to hear him were already great, and he
did not wish them to be any greater. So many people
came together from all parts of the land, and even from
places outside the land of Israel, from the country of
Tyre and Sidon on the north and from Edom or Idumea
on the south. They thronged around Jesus, and pressed
upon him; so that he spoke to his disciples to have a
little boat at hand, to wait upon him, and take him out
into the lake for quiet and rest.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus on the Mountain</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 29</div>


<div class='cap'>ABOUT TWELVE miles southwest from Capernaum
and six miles west of the Sea of Galilee stands a
mountain which can be seen many miles away.
It is now called "Kurn Hattin," which means, "The
double horns of Hattin." The name is given because
the mountain has two tops, one at each end, and a wide
hollow between them, its form making it look somewhat
like a saddle or a camel with two humps. Near this
mountain, roads ran to almost every part of the land
of Israel, so that from every place it could be reached.</div>

<p>The word went throughout the land that Jesus was
coming to this mountain; and a great multitude of
people gathered in the hollow place between its two
crowns, all waiting to see Jesus. He came to the mountain
and went up alone to one of its hill-tops. All night Jesus
was there in prayer with his heavenly Father; for he
had an important work to do, and before any great work
Jesus prayed to God. In the morning he called forth out
of the vast company of people before him twelve men,
who were to be with him all the time, go with him wherever
he should go, listen to his teachings, and learn them
by heart, and be ready to preach his words when he should
send them out. These twelve men Jesus afterward
called "apostles," which means "men sent out"; but
they were generally named "the twelve." They are also
spoken of as "the disciples," although the word "disciples"
is also used of all the followers of Jesus.</p>

<p>Most of the twelve men had been called before,
and had been for some time with Jesus. Others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
new men whom Jesus called now for the first time.
Their names are arranged in pairs, two of them together.
They were Simon Peter and Andrew his brother; James
and John, the sons of Zebedee; Philip and his friend
Bartholomew, also called Nathanael; Thomas and Matthew,
who had
been the tax-gatherer;
James
the son of Alphaeus;
another
Simon, who was
called "the Zealot,"
and Judas
Iscariot, the one
who afterward
became the traitor
and sold his
Lord to his enemies.
About
most of these
men we know
very little, but
some of them in
later years did a
great work for
the church of
Christ. Simon
Peter was always
a leader among
the Twelve, being a man of quick mind and ready words;
and John long after that time wrote "The Gospel according
to John," one of the most wonderful books in the world.</p>

<span class="caption">In the morning he called forth out of the vast company of people
before him twelve men.</span>
</div>

<p>In the sight of all the people Jesus called these men
to stand by his side. Then he came down from the
mountain-top to the hollow place between the two summits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
He sat down, with his twelve chosen men around
him, and beyond this a great crowd of people. To the
Twelve and to the listening multitude Jesus preached
that great sermon which is called "The Sermon on
the Mount." Matthew wrote it down, and you can read
it in his gospel, the first book of the New Testament,
in the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters. How fortunate
it was that Jesus called the tax-gatherer to be one of his
disciples, a man who could remember and write this great
sermon for all the world to read! We give here only a
few parts from this Sermon on the Mount. Jesus began
with words of comfort to his followers:</p>

<p>"Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn; for
they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek; for they
shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they that hunger and
thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled. Blessed
are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed
are the pure in heart; for they shall see God. Blessed
are the peacemakers; for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness'
sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>Then he spoke to his disciples of what they were to
be among men:</p>

<p>"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have
lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth
good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden
under foot of men."</p>

<p>He went on, perhaps pointing to a town not far
away, built on the top of a hill and seen everywhere
around:</p>

<p>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a
hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a lamp, and put
it under a bushel, but on the stand; and it giveth light
to all the house. Even so let your light shine before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
men, that they may see your good works and give glory
to your Father who is in heaven."</p>

<p>He told his disciples how they should feel and act
toward those who had done wrong to them:</p>

<p>"Ye have heard that it was said, 'You shall love
your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' But I say to you,
love your enemies, and pray for those who do you wrong,
that you may be sons of your Father in heaven: for he
makes his sun to rise on the bad as well as the good, and
sends rain alike on the just and on the unjust. For if
you love only those who love you, what reward do you
have? Why, the tax-gatherers whom you despise do as
much. And if you speak only to your friends, wherein
are you better than others? For even the Gentiles do the
same. You should be perfect, as your heavenly Father is
perfect."</p>

<p>He spoke also of the aims which men should seek in
their lives:</p>

<p>"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth,
where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break
through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and
where thieves do not break through nor steal; for where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

<p>"No man can serve two masters: for either he will
hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to
one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and
Mammon, who is the god worshipped by this world.
Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life,
what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink; nor for your
body, what you shall put on. Surely, life means more than
food, surely the body means more than clothes! Look
at the birds flying above you; they do not sow, nor reap,
nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feeds
them. Are you not worth more than the birds?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why should you be anxious about your clothing?
Look how the lilies of the field grow: they neither
toil nor spin, and yet Solomon in all his glory was never
robed like one of these! Now, if God so clothes the grass
of the fields, which blooms today, and tomorrow is thrown
into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you who
trust God so little?"</p>

<p>"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall
we have to eat?' or 'what shall we have to drink?' or
'how can we get clothes to wear?' Your heavenly Father
knows that you need all these things. Seek the kingdom
of God, and do right according to his will: then all these
things will be yours. Do not be anxious about tomorrow,
for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own
trouble is enough to be anxious over."</p>

<p>Here is what Jesus said as the ending of his sermon:</p>

<p>"Everyone who hears these words of mine, and acts
upon them, is like a wise man, who built his house upon
rock. The rain fell, the floods rose, the winds blew and
beat upon that house, but it did not fall, for it was
founded upon rock.</p>

<p>"And every one that hears these words of mine, and
does not act upon them, will be like a foolish man, who
built his house on sand. The rain fell, the floods rose,
the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell,
and great was its fall."</p>

<p>When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds
were filled with wonder at his way of teaching. He spoke
with the authority of a Master, unlike their own scribes.
Most of the scribes when they were teaching would speak
in the name of earlier teachers, and say, "Rabbi Jonathan
said this," or "Rabbi Hillel said that." But Jesus spoke
in his own name, saying, "I say this to you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Good Army Captain</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 30</div>


<div class='cap'>AT CAPERNAUM there was an officer of the Roman
army, a captain, having under him a company of
one hundred men. This man was not of the
Jewish people, but a Gentile, which was the name that
the Jews gave to all people outside of their own race.
All the world, except themselves, the Jews called Gentiles.</div>

<p>This army captain was a good man, and he was very
friendly to the Jews, because through them he had heard
of the true God, and had learned to worship him. Out of
his love for the Jews he had built for them with his own
money a church, and had given it to them. This may
have been the very church in which Jesus taught on the
Sabbath days.</p>

<p>The army captain had a young servant, a boy whom
he loved greatly; and this boy was very sick with the
palsy and near to death. The army captain had heard
that Jesus could cure those who were sick; and he asked
the chief men of the church, who were called its "elders,"
to go to Jesus and ask him to come to the captain's
house, that he might lay his hands on the boy and make
him well. The elders spoke to Jesus soon after he came
again to Capernaum, after preaching on the mountain.
They asked him to go with them to the captain's house
and cure his servant, and they added:</p>

<p>"He is a worthy man, and it is fitting that you should
help him, for though a Gentile, he loves our people, and
he has built for us our church."</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, "I will go and cure him."</p>

<p>But while Jesus was on his way to the captain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
house, and with him the elders and a company of people,
who hoped to see another wonderful cure, he was met by
some friends of the captain, who brought this message:</p>

<p>"Lord, do not take the trouble to come to my house:
for I am not worthy to have one so great as you are under
my roof; and I sent to you, because I am not worthy
to speak to you myself. But speak only a word where
you are, and my servant shall be made well. For although
I am myself a man under authority and rule, I have soldiers
under me to carry out my will. I say to one man
'Go,' and he goes; I say to another man 'Come,' and he
comes. I tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
You, too, have power to command and be obeyed.
Only speak the word and my servant shall be cured."</p>

<p>When Jesus heard this he wondered at this man's
faith. He turned to the crowd that followed and said:</p>

<p>"In truth I say to you all, I have not found such
faith as this in all Israel. And I tell you further, that
many like this man, who are not Israelites, shall come
from places in the east and the west, and shall sit down
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of
God. But many of those who are the children of Israel,
because they have not believed, shall never enter into
God's kingdom, but shall be thrust forth into the darkness
outside."</p>

<p>And Jesus said to those who came from the captain's
house:</p>

<p>"Go back and say to this man in my name, 'As you
have believed, even so shall it be done to you.'"</p>

<p>They went to the captain's house, and found his
servant, who had been at the point of death, now free
from his palsy and brought back to perfect health.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>




<h2>How Jesus Stopped a Funeral</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 31</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS WENT on a journey for preaching through
the southern parts of Galilee, as before he had
visited the villages among the mountains near the
sea. He walked out of Capernaum with the twelve
disciples and a crowd of followers which grew larger as
he went on. They passed by Mount Tabor, and just
before sunset they came to a small city at the foot of
another mountain, the Hill Moreh. This place was named
Nain. Outside the gate Jesus and his followers paused
to allow a funeral procession to pass by. In front were
women wailing aloud, flinging their arms up and down
and chanting a song about the young man who had died.
The body was wrapped in long strips of linen, and was
lying upon a couch, carried by bearers. After it walked
an old woman, the young man's mother, who was a
widow, burying her only son; and with her were many of
the people in the city, showing their sorrow for the widow
at the loss of her son.</div>

<p>When Jesus saw this weeping mother, he felt a great
pity for her and said to her, "Do not weep." He
stepped forward and touched the couch on which the
body was lying. The men who were carrying it stood
still with wonder at the coming of this stranger, whose
look showed power. Standing beside the dead young
man, he said:</p>

<p>"Young man, I say unto you, Rise up!"</p>

<p>Instantly the young man sat up and began to speak.
Jesus took him by the hand and gave him to his mother.
She received him into her arms, and found his cold body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
now warm with life, the dull eyes now bright. Her son
that had died that day was alive once more.</p>

<p>The people who were looking on now felt that indeed
a marvelous work had been done. Many of them had
seen Jesus before, and knew him; and even those who had
not seen him had heard of him, and said, "This must be
that great teacher from Nazareth!" Many fell on their
faces before him; and some said, "A great prophet has
come among us," and others said, "Surely God has
visited his people!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-206.jpg" width="500" height="464" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Ruins of Nain, near which Jesus restored to life the widow&#39;s son</span>
</div>

<p>The news that Jesus had raised a dead man to life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
spread through all the land and even to the countries
around. More and more people after this sought to see
Jesus and to hear his words.</p>

<p>While Jesus was slowly journeying through southern
Galilee, visiting the towns, teaching the people and curing
the sick, two men came asking to see him. These men
were followers of John the Baptist, who was still in the
prison where Herod had sent him. In his prison John
heard of the works that Jesus was doing and of the teaching
that Jesus was giving. It may be that John was
expecting Jesus to set up his kingdom at once, instead of
merely going up and down the land as a teacher. Perhaps
also, John, shut up in prison, had grown discouraged
and doubtful. In other days he had said to all the people
that Jesus was the Coming King, so high above him that
he was not worthy to tie his shoestrings. But now these
two men had brought from John this question to Jesus:</p>

<p>"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask&mdash;are you
the Coming One, the promised King of Israel? Or are
we to look for another?"</p>

<p>Jesus did not at once answer this question. He acted
for a time as though it had not been asked, and left these
two men standing, while he turned to the people about
him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus-208.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Standing beside the dead young man, Jesus said: &quot;Young man, I say unto you,
rise up!&quot; Instantly he sat up and began to speak.</span>
</div>

<p>At the Saviour's feet were many suffering people&mdash;the
sick brought upon couches by their friends, the blind
crying for sight, the deaf and dumb holding out their
hands toward him, the lepers with all their horrible
sores, the wild people in whom were evil spirits. Jesus
attended to the needs of all these sufferers. He laid his
hands upon the sick, and they rose up well; he touched
the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf, and gave
them their sight and hearing; he gave each leper a new,
pure, perfect body; and he cast out the evil spirits by
his words. Then he went on and made his usual talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to the crowds about the Kingdom of God, and how any
man might come into it.</p>

<p>When at last his morning's work of healing and teaching
was over, he turned to these two message-bearers
from John the Baptist, and said to them:</p>

<p>"Go back and tell John in his prison what you have
seen and heard. Here are men once blind who now can
see; lame men who now can walk; leprous men who have
been made clean; deaf men made to hear; men having
in them evil spirits, who are now free from their power.
You have heard too of dead men raised to life; and you
have listened while the gospel has been preached to the
poor. You go and tell John all these things that you have
seen and heard. Then let John think about these things
and judge whether I am not the One whom he promised
should come."</p>

<p>That was a far better way to bring John the Baptist
back to believing fully in Jesus as the promised King of
Israel and the Saviour of the world than to send the
answer back, "Go and tell John that I am the Saviour."
For John's faith would be the stronger, because he would
now have the proofs that Jesus was the promised Lord.</p>

<p>After these messengers from John the Baptist had
left, Jesus began to talk to the people about John. Some
may have thought that in sending this question to Jesus,
John had showed weakness and a change of his mind.
Jesus said to the people:</p>

<p>"What was it that you went out to the desert to see?
Was it a reed swayed to and fro by the wind? No, this
man John was no weak, wind-shaken reed. Did you go
out to look at a man clothed in the robes of a prince, and
eating delicate food? No, that skin-clad man in the
desert was no such princely person. To see such people
you go to the palaces of kings. Come, what <i>did</i> you
go out to see? Was it a prophet, a man sent from God?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Yes, I tell you, John the Baptist was indeed a prophet,
and more than a prophet. He was the King's messenger,
to prepare the way for the King himself. Of a truth,
I tell you all that no greater man was ever born into this
world than John the Baptist. And yet he that is least
in the Kingdom of God is higher even than John."</p>

<p>Jesus meant that those who could come into the
Kingdom of God, as those who heard the gospel might
come, were higher than even the greatest of those who
prepare the way for the Kingdom.</p>

<h2>The Sinful Woman Forgiven</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 32</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was passing through southern
Galilee, in one place a Pharisee named Simon
invited him to his house for dinner. The
Pharisees, you remember, were people who were supposed
to be very religious, because they carefully followed all
the rules about praying at regular hours every day,
whether on the street or in their homes; fasting, or not
taking food, on certain days; going to church three times
every week, and doing many things to be seen by others,
while they were often sharp and hard in their dealings
with men. They seemed to be good, but often were not
as good as they seemed. Everywhere the Pharisees were
at heart enemies of Jesus. They watched him, but in
no friendly spirit.</div>

<p>This Pharisee, Simon, wished to know Jesus and to
talk with him, although he did not believe in him. But
he felt that Jesus, being only a common carpenter who
had turned Rabbi, or teacher, was below himself in rank;
and he did not treat him with respect. When a great
man came to the house, the servants took off his sandals
and washed his feet; they dressed his hair and poured
fragrant oil upon his head. None of these things had
Simon done to Jesus. He merely invited him to his
house, and without even giving him water to wash his
feet, all dusty with walking, he pointed him to his place
at the table.</p>

<p>In that land people did not sit down upon chairs at
dinner. Around the table were placed couches or lounges,
and on these the guests reclined, half lying and half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sitting, their heads toward the table and their feet away
from it. They could reach the table and help themselves
to food or drink. Very little meat was eaten; and before
being placed upon the table, it was always cut into small
pieces, so that the guests needed no knives or forks.
After each course of the meal, a servant passed around a
bowl of water and a towel, and washed the hands of the
guests.</p>

<p>While Jesus, and perhaps his disciples with him,
were at the table during the dinner, people were coming
in and going out freely. Soon a woman came in, looked
around, saw Jesus, and went toward the couch whereon
he was lying. In her hand was a jar of fragrant oil.
She broke the jar, not waiting to take out the stopple,
and poured the oil upon his feet. She wiped his feet
with her long flowing hair; she wept over them, dropping
her many tears upon his feet; and she kissed them over
and over again.</p>

<p>All the people of that place knew who this woman
was, and knew the life that she had lived. She had not
been a good woman, but had been wicked, and was
despised by all respectable people. Simon the Pharisee
wondered that Jesus should allow such a woman to touch
him. He thought within himself, though he did not say
it aloud:</p>

<p>"This man cannot be a prophet, as they say he is;
for if he were a prophet he would know what a vile creature
this woman is, and he would not permit her hands
to touch even his feet."</p>

<p>Jesus read the thoughts of the Pharisee, for he could
look down into his mind. He said, "Simon, I have
something to say to you."</p>

<p>"Well, Teacher," answered Simon, "say it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/illus-213.jpg" width="417" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">She poured fragrant oil upon his feet and wiped them with her long flowing
hair. And Jesus said to Simon: &quot;As many as her sins have been,
they are forgiven, for her love is great.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus said, "There was a lender of money, to
whom two persons owed a debt. One owed him five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
hundred pieces of silver and the other owed him fifty.
Neither of these two men could pay his debt; and so the
money lender let them both go free. Tell me now, Simon,
which of those two men will love this man the most?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," answered Simon, "the man who had
the most forgiven."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Jesus. Then he turned toward
the woman, and went on, still speaking to Simon. "Do
you see this woman? When I came into your house, you
never even gave me water for my feet; but see, she has
wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them dry with her
hair. You never gave me a kiss of welcome; but this
woman ever since she came in has been pressing kisses
upon my feet. You never anointed my head with oil;
but she has poured perfume over my feet. Therefore I
tell you, Simon, that many as her sins have been, they are
forgiven, for her love is great; while he to whom little is
forgiven loves only a little."</p>

<p>Then he spoke to the woman, "Your sins are forgiven."</p>

<p>Those at the table began to whisper to one another,
"Who is this that claims the right to forgive sins?"</p>

<p>But he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you;
go in peace."</p>

<p>After this he went on visiting the villages and telling
the people the good news of the Kingdom of God. With
him were his twelve chosen disciples. Besides these men
were some women whom Jesus had cured of different
diseases. One was Mary Magdalene, from whom Jesus
had cast out no less than seven evil spirits. Another was
Joanna, the wife of a nobleman named Chuza, who was
a high officer in the court of King Herod Antipas, the
ruler of Galilee. Another was named Susanna; and
with these were a number of other women. Some of these
were rich, and gave freely of their money to help Jesus.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus and His Enemies</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 33</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER HIS journey through southern Galilee, which
was the second of his preaching journeys in the
land, Jesus came again to Capernaum. With him
came a great multitude of people who had listened to
him and longed to hear more of his words. For every
one who met Jesus was drawn to him in love and desired
to be with him. Nearly all who heard him loved him,
but not all. Both the scribes, who were the teachers
of the people in the law of Moses, and the Pharisees, who
pretended to a religion which was false and not real,
hated Jesus more and more and spoke evil of him to the
people. They declared that a wicked spirit was in him,
and that his power to work wonders came from Satan,
the evil one.</div>

<p>One day there was brought to Jesus a man in whom
was an evil spirit; and the spirit had taken away both his
sight and his hearing, so that he could neither see, nor
hear, nor speak. Jesus spoke to the evil spirit in the man,
saying:</p>

<p>"Come out of this man, O wicked spirit, and never
enter into him again!"</p>

<p>The evil spirit left the man's body, and for a moment
he lay on the ground as though he were dead. But soon
he rose up, entirely well and able to see, to hear and to
speak. All those who saw this cure were filled with
wonder, and many said, "Is not this the Son of David,
whom the prophets promised should come and be our
King?"</p>

<p>But when the Pharisees and scribes heard of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
wonder, they said, "This fellow casts out the evil spirits
because the chief of all the evil spirits is in him and
gives him this power."</p>

<p>Jesus knew their thoughts, and he said:</p>

<p>"Any kingdom that is divided into two sides that
are fighting each other will soon fall in pieces; and any
family where people are quarreling will soon come to
naught. If Satan, the evil one, is casting out evil spirits,
then Satan's kingdom will soon fall, for it is divided
against itself. But if by the power of God I cast out the
bad spirits from men, then you may be sure that God is
among you."</p>

<p>But this report that Jesus was possessed by evil
spirits went abroad among the people, and some believed
it. It came to the brothers of Jesus, who at that time
did not fully believe in him; and it came to Mary his
mother, filling her with alarm. She feared that her Son,
working without any rest, and bearing such heavy
loads of care, had lost his mind. Some said that the
family of Jesus should take him home and not allow
him to disturb the people, for they said, "He is beside
himself!"</p>

<p>Mary and her sons came to the house where Jesus
was talking to the people and curing the sick. So great
was the crowd around the door that they could not get
into the house, and they sent word inside that the mother
of Jesus and his brothers were out in the street and wished
to speak with him. They told Jesus:</p>

<p>"Your mother and your brothers are outside and
they wish to speak with you."</p>

<p>But he answered the man who told him, "Who is
my mother, and who are my brothers?"</p>

<p>He turned to his disciples, stretched out his hands,
and said:</p>

<p>"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
will do the will of my Father in heaven, that one is my
brother, and my sister and my mother!"</p>

<p>Jesus meant by this that dear as his mother was to
him, those who were ready to follow his teachings were
dearer still.</p>

<p>Some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke to Jesus,
saying:</p>

<p>"Teacher, show us some sign that you have come
from God."</p>

<p>They wished him to work some miracle, some wonder
in their sight. But Jesus never would do any of his
great works merely to be seen. He cured the sick and
cast out evil spirits out of pity for people in trouble, but
not as a show of his power. He said to these people:</p>

<p>"It is a wicked and unfaithful time when people
seek for a sign. I will give you no sign now, but after a
time you shall see a sign, though you will not believe it.
It will be the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah
was three days inside the great fish, so I the Son of Man
will be three days under the ground, and like Jonah will
come forth living.</p>

<p>"The people of Nineveh, to whom Jonah preached,
will rise up in the day when God shall judge the world,
and they shall show that they were better than the people
of this time, for when Jonah preached to them, they
turned from their sins and sought God. And One greater
than Jonah is here, yet they will not listen to him!</p>

<p>"The Queen of Sheba will rise up in the day of
judgment with the people of this time, and will prove them
to be unfaithful. For she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wise words of Solomon; and one greater
than Solomon is here, yet you will not listen to him."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Story-teller by the Sea</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 34</div>


<div class='cap'>SOON AFTER his journey through southern Galilee,
Jesus began to teach in a new form, that of telling
stories to the people. Everybody likes to listen to a
story, and sometimes a story will go to the heart when the
plain truth will fail. Story-tellers have always been
very abundant in the East, where Jesus lived. Even
today may be found everywhere men who go from place
to place telling stories, and the people flock around them
and listen to their stories from morning until night.</div>

<p>But the stories that Jesus told were very different
from those of the Eastern story-tellers. His stories were
told to teach some great truth, and on that account were
called "parables." A parable is a story which is true
to life&mdash;that is, a story which might be true, not a fairy
story&mdash;and which also has in it some teaching of the
truth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Once a sower went out to sow his seed. Some seed fell on stony ground and
some fell among briers and bushes.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One day Jesus went out of the city of Capernaum
and stood on the beach by the Sea of Galilee. A great
crowd of people gathered around him, for all the opposition
of the scribes and Pharisees could not keep the common
people away from Jesus. The throng was so great,
crowding around Jesus, that as before he stepped into a
boat and told his disciples to push it out a little from the
shore. Then he sat down in the boat, fronting the great
multitude that filled the sloping beach. He said to the
people:</p>

<p>"Listen! Once a sower went out to sow his seed.
And as he was scattering the seed, some of it fell on the
path, where the ground had been trodden hard. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
seed lay there on the path until the birds lighted upon
it and picked up all the kernels, so that none of them grew.</p>

<p>"Some of the seed fell on places where there was a
thin covering of earth over stones. There the kernels
grew up quickly, just because the soil was thin. But
when the hot weather came, the sun scorched the tender
plants, and they all withered away, because they had no
moisture and no root in deep earth.</p>

<p>"Some other of the seeds fell among briers and bushes,
and there was no room for the grain to grow up. It
lived, but it did not bring forth heads of grain, because
it was crowded and choked by thorn bushes all around it.</p>

<p>"But there were some other of the seeds that fell into
ground that was soft and rich and good. There they
grew up and brought forth fruit abundantly. Some
kernels gave thirty times as many as were sown, some
sixty times and some a hundred times."</p>

<p>Jesus did not tell the people what the teaching of
the parable was. He only said, "Whoever has ears, let
him hear what I have spoken." He meant that they
should not only listen but think and find out for themselves
the meaning.</p>

<p>When Jesus was alone with his disciples, they said
to him:</p>

<p>"Why do you speak to the people in parables?
What do you mean to teach in this story about the man
sowing seed?"</p>

<p>Jesus said to them:</p>

<p>"To you who have followed me it is given to know
the deep things of the Kingdom of God, because you
seek to find them out. But to many these truths are
spoken in parables, for they hear the story, but do not
try to find out what it means. They have eyes, but they
do not see, and ears, but they do not hear. For they do
not wish to understand with the heart and turn to God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to have their sins forgiven. But blessed are your eyes,
for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Listen now
to the meaning of the parable of the sower.</p>

<p>"The sower is the one who speaks the word of God,
and the seed is the word which he speaks.</p>

<p>"The seed on the roadside, the trodden path, means
those who hear, but do not take the truth into their
hearts. Then the Evil Spirit comes and, like the birds,
snatches away the truth, so that they forget it.</p>

<p>"The seeds on the rocky soil are those who hear the
word and seem to take it gladly into their hearts; but
they have no root in themselves; just as soon as they
meet with any discouragement or trouble, or find enemies
to the truth, they are turned away and their goodness
does not last.</p>

<p>"That which is sown among the thorns and briers
are those who listen to the word, but the worries of life,
and the desire for money, and the pleasures of the world,
crowd the word in their hearts, and the gospel does them
but little good.</p>

<p>"But the seed sown on the good ground are those
who listen to the gospel and understand it; who take the
word into honest and good hearts and keep it and bring
forth fruit in their lives."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<h2>More Stories Told by the Sea</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 35</div>


<div class='cap'>HERE IS another parable story that Jesus told to
the people as he sat in the boat and the people
stood on the shore. This is the parable of "The
Wheat and the Weeds."</div>

<p>"There was a man who sowed good wheat in his
field; but while people were asleep, an enemy came and
scattered the seed of weeds over all the ground. Then the
enemy went away, leaving his seed to grow up. When
the sprouts of grain began to form into heads of wheat,
the men saw that everywhere in the field the weeds were
among them, for weeds always grow faster than good
seed.</p>

<p>"So the servants of the farmer came to him and said:</p>

<p>"'Did you not, sir, sow good seed in your field?
How comes it that it is full of weeds?'</p>

<p>"He said to them, 'Some enemy of mine has done
this.'</p>

<p>"'Shall we go,' said the servants, 'and pull up the
weeds that are growing with the wheat?'</p>

<p>"'No,' answered the farmer, 'for while you are
pulling the weeds, you will root up the wheat with them.
Let them both grow together until the harvest; and in
the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, "When
you have cut down all the crop, then take out the weeds
and put them into bundles to be burned; but gather the
wheat into my barn."'"</p>

<p>Jesus gave to the people another parable about
"The Growing Grain." He said, "The kingdom of
God is as if a man should throw seed upon the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
The sower will sleep every night, while the seed will
spring up, he cannot tell how. The ground bears fruit
of itself, first the little shoot, then the ear of grain, and
then the full head of grain. But when the heads of grain
are ripe, he puts in his sickle and reaps, because the
harvest is come."</p>

<img src="images/illus-224.jpg" width="500" height="356" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus teaching by the Sea of Galilee</span>
</div>

<p>His next parable was "The Mustard Seed." "The
kingdom of heaven," said Jesus, "is like a grain of mustard
seed which a man took and sowed in his field. This is
the smallest of all seeds; but it grows up to become a
bush so large that it is like a tree, putting out great
branches, and the birds light upon them and rest under
their shadow."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/illus-225.jpg" width="387" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">While people were asleep, an enemy came and scattered the seed
of weeds over all the ground</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus gave one more parable, "The Leaven, or Yeast."
He said, "The kingdom of God is like the leaven or yeast
that a woman uses when she makes bread. She mixes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
up a very little yeast in a large mass of dough, and leaves
it to rise. Presently all the dough is changed by the
yeast, and made into good bread. So it is with the truth
to those who take it into their hearts."</p>

<p>After Jesus told these five parables, "The Sower,"
"The Wheat and the Weeds," "The Growing Grain,"
"The Mustard Seed," and "The Leaven," he sent the
crowd away and went into a house with his disciples.
When they were alone they said to him, "Tell us what is
the meaning of the parable of 'The Wheat and the
Weeds.'"</p>

<p>Jesus answered them, "He who sows the good seed
is the Son of Man, whom God has sent into the earth.
The field is the world. The good wheat are those who
hear his word and are the children of God. The weeds
are the children of the wicked one. The enemy that sowed
them is the devil, Satan. The harvest is the end of the
world and the reapers are the angels of God. Just as
the weeds are gathered from among the good grain and
burned in the fire, so shall it be at the end of the world.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather
out of his kingdom all that do evil and cause harm, and
shall throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will
weep and wail and gnash their teeth. But in that day,
the children of God, the true wheat, shall shine like the
sun in the kingdom of their heavenly Father."</p>

<p>Then to his disciples, not to the crowd, Jesus gave
three more parables. The first was "The Hid Treasure."
He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a heap of money
which a man found while he was working in a field.
He hid it again, and told no one about it; but went home,
sold all that he had and gladly bought that field, that
the treasure might be his own."</p>

<p>The next parable was that of "The Pearl." "There
was a man who went into many places to find pearls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which he bought to sell to others. In one place he found
a pearl of great price, far more precious than any that he
had seen before. He went and sold everything that he
had, and with the money bought that pearl."</p>

<p>The last of these parables was "The Drag Net."
"Once more," said Jesus, "the kingdom of heaven is
like a large net that was cast into the sea and took in
fishes of every kind, large and small, good and bad. When
the net was full they drew it to the shore. There they
sat down and took the fishes out, one by one. They
looked them over and put the good fish, those that were
fit to be eaten, into baskets, but those that were useless
they threw away. So will it be at the end of the world.
The angels will come and will take out the people that are
wicked from among the good, and shall fling them into
the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their
teeth."</p>

<p>After Jesus had finished telling these parables to his
disciples, he said to them, "Have you understood all
these?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "Yes, we have."</p>

<p>And he said to them, "Every teacher who has been
made a learner in the kingdom of God is like a man who
brings out of his store some things that are new and some
that are old."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2>Sailing Across the Sea</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 36</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE day of teaching in parables, when the
evening came on, as the crowds were still pressing
upon Jesus and giving him no time to rest, he said
to his disciples:</div>

<p>"Let us sail across the lake to the other side."
So they made ready the boat and took Jesus on board.
Some of the people were so eager to be with Jesus that
they also went into other boats and sailed with him.
Jesus was very tired after his day of teaching and he
lay down in the rear end of the boat, resting his head upon
one of the cushions. In the steady motion of the oars
and the gentle rippling of the waves, Jesus soon fell
asleep, while the boat moved onward over the lake.
Soon the night came and the disciples rowed on in the
darkness.</p>

<p>On the Sea of Galilee, storms often arise very suddenly.
The water may be perfectly calm for a time and
then in a few minutes lashed into fury by the wind. So
it came to pass while Jesus was sleeping. A great wind
arose, the waves rolled high and dashed into the boat;
but Jesus slept on peacefully.</p>

<p>At least four of the twelve disciples, and we know
not how many more, were fishermen. They knew how
dangerous these sudden storms might be; and as they
saw the boat filling with water and beginning to sink,
they were frightened. Coming to Jesus, they awoke
him, crying out, "Master, Master, we are lost! Help
us or we shall drown!"</p>

<p>The storm, with all the noise of creaking sails and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
roaring winds and dashing waves, had not awaked Jesus,
but the cries of his frightened disciples aroused him from
his sleep. He looked around, saw the dashing waves
and said just these words:</p>

<p>"Peace, be still!"</p>

<p>At once the wind ceased, the waves smoothed down
and there was perfect calm upon the sea. Then Jesus
spoke to his disciples, saying:</p>

<p>"Why are you so fearful? Have you so little faith
in me?"</p>

<p>They might have known that whether their Master
was awake or asleep, they were safe if he was with them.
They wondered at this new proof of Jesus' power, and
said to each other:</p>

<p>"Who can this be that can speak to the winds and
the waves and they obey his words!"</p>

<p>They were sailing from Capernaum in a direction
southeast, and after rowing about seven miles, they
came to the eastern shore of the lake, where was a village
called Gerasa. This region was called "the country of
the Gadarenes," from a large city, Gadara, not far away.
It was a part of Decapolis, a name given to all the country
on the east of the Sea of Galilee. The word Decapolis
means "The Ten Cities," and because in that land were
ten large Roman cities, the whole country was called
"The Country of Ten Cities."</p>

<p>It must have been very early in the morning when
Jesus and his disciples brought their boats to the shore
at Gerasa. Just as they were landing, a man came
running down the hill to meet them, and from his wild
acts they saw that he was one of those wretched people
who were under the power of evil spirits. This man wore
no clothes; he would not live in any house, but stayed
in the caves in the hillside, which were used as burial
places. They had tried to bind him with ropes and chains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
but when the evil power was on him, he would break all
his bonds and even snap his chains apart. He stayed all
the time among the tombs, crying, moaning and gashing
himself with sharp stones.</p>

<p>This wild man ran toward Jesus and fell at his feet.
As soon as Jesus saw the state he was in, he spoke to the
evil spirit within the man:</p>

<p>"Come out of this man, you vile spirit!"</p>

<p>The spirit answered Jesus, crying out, "Jesus, son
of the Most High God, what business have you with us?
In the name of God, I call upon you not to make us suffer!"</p>

<p>Jesus saw that this man's state was far worse than
even most of those who were ruled by evil spirits. He
said to the spirit, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Legion," answered the evil spirit;
meaning that in the man was not only one, but many of
the evil spirits, a whole army of them, for the word
"legion" means an army.</p>

<p>The demons, or evil spirits, begged Jesus not to
send them far away. On the top of the hill was a herd
of many hogs feeding. The Jewish people were not
allowed to keep hogs nor to eat their flesh, so this drove
of hogs must have belonged to foreign people, whom the
Jews called Gentiles.</p>

<p>The evil spirits asked Jesus if when they left the man,
they might go into these hogs; and Jesus allowed them.
Then the demons or evil spirits went out of the man,
leaving him lying upon the ground, naked but well.
They went into the drove of hogs, and the hogs instantly
became wild and could not be controlled. They rushed
in a great mass down the steep side of the hill and into
the water. There they were all drowned, about two
thousand in number. The men who kept the hogs ran
to the town near by, and told all the people what had
happened; how the demons at the command of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stranger had left the man, had gone into the drove of
hogs and had caused them to drown in the waters. The
people of the city came out to see for themselves what had
taken place. They saw the man in whom had been the
fierce evil spirits, now sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed
and in his right mind, calm and peaceful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-232.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The evil spirits went out of the man into the hogs, causing them to rush down
the hill into the water</span>
</div>

<p>These Gadarene people evidently knew nothing
of Jesus and the many good works that he had done.
They were filled with dread of his power, and scarcely
looking at the man whom Jesus had helped so wonderfully,
thought only of the hogs which they had lost.
They begged Jesus to go away from their land and not
to come to their town. Think what blessings Jesus might
have brought to them, in curing their sick, giving sight
to the blind, and hearing to the deaf, besides the good
news of his teaching! But with no knowledge of these
good gifts, they asked Jesus to leave them.</p>

<p>And Jesus took them at their word. Sadly he turned
away, went down to the beach and stepped into the boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
The man who had been set free from the evil spirits begged
most earnestly to be allowed to go with Jesus. He may
have feared that the people of the city would be angry
with him because the demons in him had killed their
hogs; or he may have thought that the evil spirits might
come back to him if he was left alone, without his mighty
helper near. He knew that he would be safe if he were
with his Lord, and he asked again and again that he might
go away with Jesus, wherever he might go.</p>

<p>But Jesus would not grant his prayer. He said to the
man:</p>

<p>"Go home to your own people, and tell them what
great things the Lord has done for you, and how he has
taken pity on you."</p>

<p>The man went through all the country of Decapolis
and told everybody whom he met what great things
Jesus had done for him. When they heard this, they all
wondered, and no doubt many wished that they had
welcomed Jesus instead of sending him away.</p>

<h2>The Sick Woman Made Well and
the Dead Girl Brought to Life</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 37</div>


<div class='cap'>A GREAT CROWD of people were on the shore at
Capernaum, looking earnestly over the sea. On
the evening before they had seen Jesus with his
disciples in their boats pushing off from the beach and
sailing out into the lake; and now they were watching
for their return. Close by the water was standing one
man, whose face showed that he was in great trouble, as
he gazed anxiously in every direction over the sea.</div>

<p>This man was named Jairus. He was the chief elder
over the church in the town, which they called the
synagogue. At home his little daughter twelve years
old was lying very ill and likely to die at any moment.
Jairus knew that if Jesus should come ashore in time,
before his daughter would die, he could save her life;
so with hope and fear mingled, he stood on the shore
watching for Jesus to come, but fearing that he might
come too late.</p>

<p>At last he could see the large boat rising in sight and
drawing nearer, with other smaller boats around it.
Before Jesus could step ashore, Jairus fell down upon his
face before him and cried out:</p>

<p>"O Master, come to my house just as soon as you
can! My little daughter is lying at the point of death;
I pray you, come and lay your hands upon her so that she
may live and be made well."</p>

<p>Jesus went with him, and all the crowd followed,
pressing closely upon him; some showing pity and hope
for Jairus in his trouble, but more of them wishing to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Jesus do one of his wonderful works. In the edge of
the crowd was standing a poor woman, wasted by sickness
and as pale as death. She had a running sore, which
for twelve years had drained away her blood. She was
very eager to go to Jesus, for she believed that he could
cure her sore, although many doctors had tried in vain
to help her. She had spent all her money upon the doctors,
one after another, but no one of them had done
her any good, and she was all the time growing
worse. Jesus was in the middle of this great crowd,
and this woman was very weak, but by making a
strong effort she was able to get near enough to Jesus,
not to speak to him, but to reach her hand between
those who were walking nearest to him and to touch
his clothes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great hope arose in her heart. She said
to herself, "I really believe that if I can just touch the
Master's clothes I will be made well!"</p>

<p>She reached out with trembling hand and touched
the outer robe of Jesus. In an instant she felt a strange
power come into her body and she knew that the sore
was cured. She was well and strong!</p>

<p>At that moment Jesus stopped in his walk, while
Jairus was trying to hurry him onward. He stood still,
looked all around, and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</p>

<p>His disciples were beside him, and Peter answered:</p>

<p>"Why, Master, the crowd is all around, pressing
close upon you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'
while people are touching you all the time."</p>

<p>But Jesus said, "I am sure that somebody touched
me, because I felt that power had gone out from me."</p>

<p>As he stood still and looked all around to see who had
done this, the woman came forward out of the crowd and
fell down at his feet, trembling with fear, afraid that she
had offended him. She told of what she had suffered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
how she had touched his clothing and had been made
well. Jesus said to her:</p>

<p>"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in
peace and be free from your sickness."</p>

<p>But while Jesus was delaying for these few moments,
Jairus was standing by his side in growing alarm, for to
him and his dying child every minute was precious.
Just then some one from his own house came up to him
through the crowd and said:</p>

<p>"Your daughter is dead; what is the use of asking
the Teacher to come any further? Not even he can help
her now."</p>

<p>These people had not heard how Jesus some weeks
before had raised to life the widow's son at Nain, for that
village was at least twenty-five miles from Capernaum.</p>

<p>But Jesus spoke encouragingly to the sorrowing
father. "Have no fear; only believe, and she shall yet
be well."</p>

<p>They went to the house of Jairus, and the crowd
would have followed him inside, but Jesus forbade them.
He allowed none to go with him into the house, except
the father and three of his disciples, Peter, James and
John.</p>

<p>The house was full of people, weeping and wailing,
playing on flutes and making a great noise, as the manner
was then and is even now in that land. Men and women
are paid to come to the house where one is lying dead,
and to scream and cry aloud, so that all in the town may
know of the death and of the sorrow of the family.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the people in the house, "Why do you
make such a noise? The little girl is not dead, but only
sleeping."</p>

<span class="caption">Jesus went into the room where the daughter of Jairus was lying dead on the
bed, and taking her hand into his own said: &quot;Little girl,
I say to you, rise up!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus meant by these words that we need not be
filled with sorrow when our friends die; for death is
only a sleep until the time when God shall awaken them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
But this they did not understand; and they would not be
comforted, for they knew that the child was dead.</p>

<p>Jesus ordered all these hired mourners to leave the
house. He went into the room where the dead child was
lying on the bed, taking with him only her father and
mother, with his three chosen disciples. Standing beside
the dead body, he took its little hand into his own and
said:</p>

<p>"Little girl, I say to you, rise up!"</p>

<p>And instantly the girl stood up, looked around and
began to walk. How happy were that father and mother
as they clasped in their arms their little girl, no longer
dead, but living and well. All were filled with wonder.
They would have told everybody about this mighty work,
but Jesus said to them:</p>

<p>"Give the child something to eat, but do not talk
about her being brought back to life. Tell no one of it."</p>

<h2>Sight to the Blind and Voice
to the Dumb</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 38</div>


<div class='cap'>AS JESUS was coming out of the house where he had
raised to life the young girl, two blind men met
him; for the news of his return to Capernaum had
gone abroad, and these two men, eager to obtain their
sight, at once set out to find Jesus. They followed Jesus
on the street, crying out aloud:</div>

<p>"Have mercy on us, O Son of David!"</p>

<p>You know that Jesus came from the family of which
David had been the head long before. All the people
looked for him, as sprung from David, to take David's
throne, and like David, become king over all the land.
The people who believed that Jesus was to be king often
called him "Son of David."</p>

<p>These two blind men followed Jesus, crying to him,
until he went into the house where he was staying, which
may have been the house where Simon Peter lived. The
blind men came into the house after Jesus. He said to
them:</p>

<p>"Do you believe that I can do this which you desire?"</p>

<p>They answered him, "Yes, Lord, we believe that you
can."</p>

<p>Then Jesus placed his hands upon their eyes, first on
one man and then on the other. As he touched their eyes,
he said to them, "As you believe, let it be done to you."</p>

<p>At once their eyes were opened and they could see.
Jesus spoke to them very strongly, and gave them
special orders, saying, "See that nobody knows of this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not wish always to have crowds around seeking
for miracles of healing, for he felt that he had a
greater work to do in preaching to the souls of men than
in curing their bodies. But these men went away and
told all whom they met what a wonderful thing Jesus had
done for them. It was not strange that they should speak
of it, even though he had forbidden them, for all who had
known them before as blind men saw the great change in
their looks, now that they could see, and asked them
how it had come to pass; so that it was not easy to avoid
telling people about it. But wherever it was told, people
who had any disease, or were blind, or deaf and dumb, or
lame, were filled with desire to find Jesus and be made
well.</p>

<p>Soon after these two men left Jesus, cured of their
blindness, another man was brought to Jesus. This was a
dumb man, in whom lived an evil spirit. Jesus always
cast out the evil spirits, without waiting to be asked,
whenever he found them ruling over men. He spoke to
this evil spirit, and it left the man. Then all at once the
man began to speak, for it was the evil spirit in him that
had made him dumb. All the people wondered, and
said to one another:</p>

<p>"Such power as this has never before been seen in
the land of Israel!"</p>

<p>But the scribes and Pharisees, who were enemies of
Jesus, said again, as they had said before:</p>

<p>"This man casts out the evil spirits, because Satan,
the prince of the evil spirits, helps him."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>




<h2>Twelve Preachers Sent Out</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 39</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS HAD now preached in nearly all parts of Galilee,
except in the middle portion, the region around
Nazareth, the home of his younger days. You
remember that when he had tried to speak in Nazareth,
soon after coming from Judea, the people refused to listen
to him, thinking that one who had been only a workingman
and not a Rabbi or scribe could not teach them
anything.</div>

<p>But Jesus loved those people in Nazareth, for many
of the men had been with him boys at school; and his own
sisters lived there with their children, boys and girls, who
were his nephews and nieces. He longed to see them all,
and made up his mind to go again to Nazareth, and see
if its people would this time listen to him. On his earlier
visit he had been alone, and the men of Nazareth in their
anger had tried to kill him by throwing him down a very
steep hill; but now Jesus had with him his twelve disciples
and many more who followed him from place to
place. On this visit the men of Nazareth did not venture
to do him harm, because of his many friends around
him.</p>

<p>As before, Jesus went to the village church on the
Sabbath day and preached. Again the people listened
to him with wonder at his words; but again they said:</p>

<p>"Is not this the carpenter who used to make plows
and hoes and tables for us? How can he teach us?"</p>

<p>He could only do a few of his great works, because the
people would not believe in him. He did, indeed, lay his
hands upon a few that were sick, and made them well;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
but he could only wonder at the hardness of heart in
those among whom he had lived so many years.</p>

<p>Leaving Nazareth with a sad heart, he went around
the villages in middle Galilee, teaching in the churches
and curing sickness of all kinds. As he saw how poor
the people were, how
little they knew of the
truth, and how greatly
they longed for it, he
felt a great pity for
them. They seemed to
Jesus like sheep that
were lost and wandering,
not having any
shepherd. He said to
his disciples:</p>

<p>"The harvest truly
is rich, but the workers
in it are very few. Pray
very earnestly to the
Lord of the harvest that
he may send out workers
to gather in his
harvest."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/illus-243.jpg" width="284" height="450" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Peace be to this house&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus knew that
the time of his work in
Galilee was nearly ended.
There were other
parts of the land of Israel where he had not yet preached,
and he wished to visit them. He knew, too, what none
but himself knew, that in a year he would be taken away
from the earth, and his disciples would be left alone to
carry on his work and preach to all the people the news
of God's kingdom. He made up his mind to send out
his twelve disciples, whom he named "the apostles," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to let them begin their work by preaching in the villages
of Galilee which he had not found time to visit.</p>

<p>So he called together his twelve disciples, and
divided them into pairs, sending two men together, that
they might help each other. He poured upon them some
of his own power to cure diseases and to cast out evil
spirits from men. He gave them commands about their
work, to whom they should go and how they should act.
He said:</p>

<p>"Do not go to any city of the Gentiles, the foreigners;
and keep away from the villages of the Samaritan people.
Your work just now is to be among the lost sheep of the
house of Israel. Go to the Jews throughout the land, and
tell them that the kingdom of God has come, and that
they may enter it. Cure the sick, raise the dead to life,
cleanse the lepers, cast out the evil spirits from men.
Give freely, without being paid; for you have received
the gift of God freely.</p>

<p>"Do not take with you any money of gold or silver
or copper in your girdle; nor a bag to carry food for the
road; nor two shirts, nor a pair of shoes; but go wearing
only sandals on your feet. For God's workman deserves
his food, and it will be given to him.</p>

<p>"When you come to a village, ask for some good man,
go to his house, and stay there while you are in that
village. Do not go visiting from one house to another.
When you come to a house say, 'Peace be to this house.'
If the people dwelling in that house are worthy of your
peace, then peace shall be given to them; if they are not
worthy, your peace shall come back to you. And if in
any place the people will not hear you nor give you
welcome, then as you go out of that house or that city,
take off your sandals and shake the dust of that place
from them as a sign. I say to you in truth that in the day
of judgment it shall be worse for the cities that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
refused you than for Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities
upon which God rained down fire.</p>

<p>"You are sent forth like sheep among wolves; so
be wise like serpents, yet harmless like doves. But you
must watch against evil men, for they will seize you and
hand you over to
courts to be judged;
you will be beaten
in their court-rooms;
you will be brought
before governors
and kings, because
you are my followers.
Now, when they
bring you up for
trial, do not be anxious
about what you
shall speak or how
you shall say it; for
what to speak shall
be given you when
you need it. For it
is not you that
speak, but the spirit
of your Father in
heaven that speaks
in you."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Whoever gives to one of these little ones
even a cup of cold water because he is my
disciple, he will not lose his reward&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Many more
words Jesus spoke to his twelve disciples; and at the end
of his charge he said this:</p>

<p>"Whoever receives you and listens to you, it is the
same as though he received me, your teacher; and whoever
receives me, receives my Father who sent me. He
that receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall
receive a prophet's reward. He who receives a good man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
because he is a good man shall receive a good man's
reward. And whoever gives to one of these little ones
even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple of mine,
I tell you truly, he will not lose his reward."</p>

<p>After giving his commands to the twelve disciples,
Jesus sent them out to preach, while he himself went to
other places telling the people the good news of the
Kingdom of God.</p>

<h2>A Dance; and How It Was
Paid For</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 40</div>


<div class='cap'>DURING NEARLY all the year of Jesus' teaching
and preaching in Galilee, John the Baptist was
in Herod's prison at a lonely place called Machærus,
on the east of the river Jordan, near the Dead Sea.
You remember that John was put into prison because
King Herod's queen, Herodias, became angry against
him, when John said to Herod that it was not right for
him to take away his brother's wife and have her as his
own. Herodias hated John and tried many times to
have him killed, but Herod held John in high respect
and would not suffer him to be slain.</div>

<p>But at last the chance came for Herodias to carry
out her purpose. On King Herod's birthday, he held at
Machærus, which was not only a prison but a palace,
a great feast to his lords, the captains of his army, and the
chief men of his kingdom. At this feast the daughter of
Herodias, a young girl, came in and danced before the
company. Herod and the guests with him were so
delighted with the girl's dancing that the king made her
a very foolish promise. He said to her:</p>

<p>"You may ask for anything that you please, and I
will give it to you." He went further and even swore with
an oath to her, "I will give you whatever you choose,
even to half of my kingdom."</p>

<p>The girl went to her mother and said to her, "What
shall I ask?"</p>

<p>And Herodias hissed out the words, "You ask for
the head of John the Baptist."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl went in haste to the king, and said, "I want
you to give me here on a platter the head of John the
Baptist."</p>

<p>The king was greatly displeased and very angry.
He knew that his wife Herodias had led the girl to make
this choice, and he would have liked to break his promise.
But because he had given his word and was ashamed to
call it back before all the nobles at his feast, he gave
orders, very unwillingly, to his guards to have her will
carried out. They went into the prison, and with a sharp
sword cut off the head of John the Baptist, the best and
noblest man in all his kingdom. The head was laid on
a platter and given to the young girl, who carried it to
her mother. So the man whom Jesus called "a prophet
and more than a prophet" was slain to satisfy the whim
of a dancing girl and her wicked mother!</p>

<img src="images/illus-248.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The daughter of Herodias dancing before Herod</span>
</div>

<p>The few followers who had still clung to John the
Baptist, and visited him in his prison, took up his headless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
body and buried it. Then they went to Jesus and
told him all the sad story of John's death.</p>

<p>But Herod was not yet done with John the Baptist.
Soon he began to hear wonderful stories of the new
prophet, Jesus the Nazarene, who had risen up in John's
place. He heard that amazing powers were shown by
Jesus, that the sick were cured, the lepers were made
clean, the blind were made to see, and, most wonderful
of all, the dead were raised to life.</p>

<p>People were saying to each other, "Who is this great
Prophet that is working all these wonders?"</p>

<p>Some said, "This is the old prophet Elijah, who has
come to earth again."</p>

<p>Others said, "If he is not Elijah, it may be Jeremiah
or some other prophet of the old times."</p>

<p>But Herod was filled with a terrible fear, for his
conscience troubled him on account of his wicked deeds.
He said:</p>

<p>"I know who this is. It is John the Baptist, whose
head I had cut off. He has come to life again. It is on
his account that all these wonderful things are taking
place!"</p>

<p>Thus the bloody head of John the Baptist, like a
terrible ghost, rose before the sight of Herod the king!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Boy with His Five Loaves</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 41</div>


<div class='cap'>THE NEWS that King Herod had slain the holy
prophet John the Baptist sent a thrill of horror to
all who heard it. It came to the twelve disciples,
who were just completing their work of preaching in
the villages of Galilee. They feared that Herod might
seize them and put them in prison; but they were more
alarmed for their Master. Having slain John who had
made Jesus known to the people, they feared that Herod
might now try to kill Jesus himself.</div>

<p>They all hastened to Capernaum, where they found
Jesus, and gave him the report of the places which they
had visited, the work which they had done in healing and
helping people and the message which they had given
everywhere about the Kingdom of God. The disciples
found the crowds around Jesus greater than ever before;
for not only had the preaching of these disciples aroused
an interest in Jesus and led many to leave their homes and
seek him, but the Passover, the greatest of all Jewish
feasts, was to be held soon, and the city of Capernaum
was thronged with people who were on their way to Jerusalem;
for as you know, this feast was held only in that
city, and from every part of the land people went up to
Jerusalem to attend it.</p>

<p>So many were the people coming and going and those
who were looking for Jesus and seeking his power to cure
their diseases, that Jesus and his disciples could scarcely
find a chance to eat. The crowds were constantly
pressing upon them. He said to his disciples:</p>

<p>"Come, let us take the boat and go across the lake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
some quiet place, away from the crowds, and there rest
for a time."</p>

<p>They went into the boat and started to row over the
lake. But the people saw them going and many tried to
follow them. Those who had boats sailed in them after
the course in which they saw the boat with Jesus and his
disciples. And the others, a great multitude, walked and
ran around the head of the lake, waded across the river
Jordan where it enters the Sea of Galilee, still keeping
Jesus' boat in sight, and were at the beach to meet Jesus
when he landed near the town of Bethsaida, which was on
the northeastern shore. Here Jesus was safe, for Bethsaida
was outside the rule of King Herod and in the land
governed by Herod's brother Philip.</p>

<p>When Jesus stepped out of his boat on the shore
near Bethsaida, there he found a great throng of people,
more than five thousand men, besides some women and
children. When Jesus saw how eager they were and how
glad to meet him, his heart of love and pity went out
toward them. He cured some sick people that they had
brought and he spoke to them about the kingdom of
God.</p>

<p>The day began to draw to its close and the sun was
almost sinking below the hills of Galilee, when the
disciples said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"It is getting late and will soon be night. These
crowds of people came so suddenly that they have brought
with them nothing to eat. Send them away, so that
they may go to the city of Bethsaida and the villages
around and buy food and find places to stay through the
night. We are here, you see, in a desert place, where
there is neither food nor lodging for them."</p>

<p>But Jesus said to his disciples, "There is no need for
them to go away; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'do you'">you</ins> give them something to eat."</p>

<p>They said to him, "Shall we go into the town and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
buy thirty dollars' worth of bread, so that each one of
them may have a little?"</p>

<p>Jesus turned to Philip, one of his disciples, and asked
him, "Philip, where shall we find bread that all these
people may eat?"</p>

<p>Jesus said this to try Philip's faith, for he himself
knew already what he would do. Philip looked over
the crowd gathered upon the level ground, and he
answered, "Thirty dollars' worth of bread would not be
enough to give to each one even a little piece."</p>

<p>Jesus said to his disciples, "How many loaves have
you? Go and see."</p>

<p>Just then another of the disciples, Andrew, the
brother of Simon Peter, came up to Jesus and said,
"There is a boy here who has five loaves of barley bread
and two little fishes; but what use would they be among
so many people?"</p>

<p>Jesus said, "Bring them to me."</p>

<p>So they led to Jesus this boy with his lunch basket,
in which his mother had placed five large flat biscuits
of barley and two small salted fishes.</p>

<p>Jesus said to his disciples, "Go out among the
people and tell them to arrange themselves into companies,
with fifty or a hundred in each company, and to sit down
upon the grass."</p>

<p>The disciples did as Jesus ordered, and soon all the
crowd was divided up into groups of fifty or a hundred
people, all seated on the ground. On the green grass,
arranged in rows and squares with their clothes of different
colors, they looked like beds of flowers.</p>

<p>Then, in the sight of all the people, Jesus took the
five loaves and the two fishes. He waved his hand for
silence, and while all were still, looked up to heaven, gave
thanks to God for his gift of food, and blessed it. He
broke the loaves which were like large flat crackers or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
biscuit, and gave to each of his disciples a piece and also
a piece of dried fish. The disciples went among the
people breaking off pieces of the loaves and fishes and
handing them out. As they were broken, the loaves and
fishes grew in their hands, until every one in the company
had enough to eat.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, "Go and gather up the pieces of
food that are left, so that nothing may be wasted."</p>

<p>Each of the twelve disciples carried a basket among
the people, and took from them all that was left. When
they came back to Jesus, all the twelve baskets were
filled with the pieces left over of the loaves and fishes.
There had been in the beginning only five loaves and two
fishes. Of these, five thousand men, besides women and
children, had eaten as much as they wanted. And now
came back twelve baskets full of bits left over&mdash;much
more at the end after all had eaten than at the beginning.</p>

<p>When the people saw that here was one who could
give them food, all that they wanted, they said to each
other, "This is the man that we want for our king!
He can give us bread to eat without our working for it.
Let us break away from the rule of the Romans and make
Jesus our king!"</p>

<p>Jesus knew their thoughts and what they were saying
to each other, for he knew all things. He knew, too,
that he was a king, but not such a king as they wished.
His kingdom was to be in the hearts of those who loved
him, not a kingdom won by armies and by swords.
Jesus found that his disciples were pleased to find the
people so eager at once to crown Jesus as their King,
for that would mean high rank and offices for themselves.</p>

<p>Jesus, therefore, began by sending away his disciples.
He compelled them, much against their will, to get into
the boat, and to row over the lake toward Capernaum.
After sending away his disciples, he sent away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
multitudes, who were also unwilling to go, for they
could not understand why Jesus should refuse to be made
king.</p>

<p>When all were gone away and quiet was around him
and the night had come on, Jesus went to the top of a
mountain near by, and spent some hours in prayer to his
heavenly Father. He needed prayer, for he saw in this
attempt to make him king another effort of Satan to
bring Jesus under his power, by giving him a worldly
kingdom, instead of a heavenly.</p>

<h2>How the Sea Became a Floor</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 42</div>


<div class='cap'>ON THE night after the multitude was fed with the
five loaves, while Jesus was praying alone on the
mountain, his disciples were rowing over the lake
toward Capernaum. It was very dark; and soon after
midnight a terrible storm arose, as storms often come
very suddenly upon the Sea of Galilee. From his mountain
top, through all the darkness and miles away,
Jesus could see them struggling with the waves, and in
great danger of losing their lives, for he could see all
things.</div>

<p>While the disciples were pulling hard with their
oars, suddenly they saw someone walking upon the
waves and drawing near their boat. They were more
alarmed, when they saw this form walking over the waves
as though the waters were a solid floor, than they had
been at the storm threatening to swallow them up, for
they thought that surely this was a spirit from the world
of the dead, coming to give warning that death was
awaiting them. They cried out in their terror; but soon
heard a voice speaking to them above the roaring of the
wind and the dashing of the waves; a voice which they
knew well. It was the voice of Jesus, saying:</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer! it is I; do not be afraid!"</p>

<p>Then they knew that it was no spirit or ghost from
the grave, but their own Lord and Saviour coming to help
them. What a load of fear was lifted from them when
they heard that voice!</p>

<p>But one of the disciples, one who was always putting
himself in the front, thought that if Jesus could walk on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the water, he would like to do the same. You would
know that this one was Simon Peter, a good man, but
very quick in his impulses. He cried out, as Jesus drew
near, "Lord, if it is really you, command me to come to
you on the water."</p>

<p>And the Lord said, "Come." Then Peter leaped
overboard from the boat and began to walk on the water
toward Jesus. But after a few steps on the sea, he saw
how heavy the storm was, and was afraid; and at that
moment he began to sink. He shouted out, "Lord,
save me!"</p>

<p>Jesus reached out his hand and caught him and kept
him from sinking, saying to him:</p>

<p>"How little you trust me! Why did you doubt my
word?"</p>

<p>When Jesus, holding Peter's hand, came with him
into the boat, the wind stopped, and the sea became calm.
They found that they were close to the land. Then all
the men in the boat fell down at the feet of Jesus and
said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"</p>

<p>Soon the daylight came, and they saw that their
boat was beside a plain, reaching into the lake, a few
miles south of Capernaum, called the land of Gennesaret.
They went ashore and drew up their boat on the beach.
The people of that place knew Jesus, for many of them
had heard him in Capernaum. They were glad to have
him come to their land; and sent word through all the
plain that Jesus, the great teacher and healer, had landed
on their shore. From all the country around they brought
on their beds those that were sick, and laid them before
Jesus, begging him to cure them. Many came near his
side, and asked him if they might only touch the border
of the mantle which he wore; and all who touched it
were made perfectly well, so strong was their faith in
Jesus.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Bread of Life</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 43</div>


<div class='cap'>ON THE morning after the day when Jesus had fed
the five thousand people with the five loaves,
the crowd came together once more, hoping again
to see Jesus; and some of them expecting to have the
miracle or wonder-work repeated. On the evening before,
they had seen the twelve disciples go out upon the lake
in their boat, and had noticed that Jesus did not sail
with them. They thought that Jesus must still be there,
and looked all around for him, not knowing that in the
night he had walked upon the sea to help his disciples
in the storm. Failing to find Jesus, they thought that
he must have gone back to his home in Capernaum.
They found some other boats upon the shore, and in
these they crossed the lake to Capernaum.</div>

<p>They found Jesus at the church in Capernaum, and
said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</p>

<p>"I tell you the truth," answered Jesus, "it is not on
account of the signs of power which you saw that you are
looking for me, but because you ate of the bread which I
gave you, and had your fill. You should work, not for
the food which does not last, but for that which endures
to everlasting life; that bread the Son of Man will give
you, for upon him the Father has set his seal of power."</p>

<p>Jesus wished them to understand that the truth
which he could give them was more to the soul than food
was to the body, for it would give the life of God, which
never passes away.</p>

<p>"In what way," they asked him, "can we do the
work that God would have us do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"The work that God would have you do," answered
Jesus, "is to believe in him whom God has sent to you
as his message-bearer."</p>

<p>"Well, then," they said to Jesus, "show us the sign
that will prove that you have come from God, then we
will believe in you. What is the work that you are
doing? Our fathers under Moses in the desert ate the
manna that Moses gave them. You remember that it is
written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"</p>

<p>You see, the people wanted Jesus to show his power
again by repeating the miracle with the loaves, and giving
them more bread in the same way.</p>

<p>"In truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "it was not
Moses who gave your fathers the bread from heaven;
it was my Father, the Lord God. And my Father does
give you now the real bread from heaven. For God's
bread is that which comes down from heaven and gives
life to the world."</p>

<p>"Master," they said, "give us that bread always!"</p>

<p>"I am the life-giving bread," answered Jesus. "He
who comes to me shall never be hungry, and he who
believes in me shall never be thirsty. But, as I told you,
you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me.
All those whom the Father gives me will come to me;
and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away. For
I have come down from heaven not to carry out my own
will, but the will of Him who sent me; and his will is
this&mdash;that I should not lose even one of all those whom He
has given me, but shall raise them up to life at the last
great day. For it is the will of my Father that every one
who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have everlasting
life; and I myself will raise him up at the last day."</p>

<p>The Jews who heard Jesus began to find fault with
him for saying, "I am the bread which came down from
heaven."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his
father and mother. How can he say, 'I came down from
heaven?'"</p>

<p>They could not understand his words, and they were
angry with him because he would not again work the
miracle of giving them bread. Also they now found
that Jesus was not willing to be a king such as they
wanted, one that would sit on a throne and live in a
palace; would raise an army to drive away the Romans
and make the Jews a ruling people upon the earth. It
was, as we have seen, the time of the Passover, and one
reason for the great crowds around Jesus was that all
were expecting him to lead the people to Jerusalem and
take his place as the king of Israel. But this year Jesus
did not go, as he usually did, to the feast in Jerusalem,
for he had other plans for himself and his disciples.</p>

<p>When the crowd following Jesus found that he would
not be a king according to their desires, that he would
not do wonders for them to look upon, and that his
words were such as they could not understand, nearly
all of them turned against Jesus. They went away,
leaving the twelve disciples alone with him.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the Twelve, "Do you, too, wish to leave
me?"</p>

<p>Simon Peter answered for them all, "Lord, to whom
shall we go if we leave you? You have the words that
will give us everlasting life. And we believe and are
certain that you are the Holy One of God."</p>

<p>These men did not understand all the words of
Jesus, but they had learned to love him and to believe
that he was the promised King. They were ready to
stay with him until death.</p>

<p>"Did I not choose you to be the Twelve?" said
Jesus, "and yet, even among you there is one who is
doing the devil's work."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not know of whom he was speaking; but
he meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; the one of
the twelve disciples who a year afterward was to give
up his Master to death. At that time Judas himself
did not know this. Jesus, who could read the hearts of
men, saw in Judas the signs all unknown to himself that
he would do this dreadful deed.</p>

<h2>Jesus in a Strange Country</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 44</div>


<div class='cap'>WITH HIS sermon on "The Bread of Life,"
given in the church at Capernaum, Jesus finished
his work among the people of Galilee. He had
lived in that land for more than a year; he had traveled
through every part of it; he had spoken in most of its
villages and cities, and had sent out his disciples to
preach in many other places. Everybody in Galilee
had either heard Jesus or had heard about him. If they
did not believe in him and his gospel, it was because they
would not.</div>

<p>There was another and important work which now
lay before Jesus. That was the training of his twelve
disciples. These men, the apostles, as they were called
later, had been with him for nearly a year. They had
listened to his preaching and had heard his sermons many
times, over and over again; for in different places Jesus
gave the same talks to the people; but those talks and
parables the Twelve heard in each place, as Jesus wished
those men to hear his words until they knew them by
heart and could give them as his message to others who
had not heard Jesus himself.</p>

<p>One reason why we have in the four gospels, by
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, so many of the teachings
and parables of Jesus, is that the disciples heard them so
many times, learned them, could tell them to others;
and thus at least thirty years after Jesus passed away
from earth, his words were remembered and could be
written down.</p>

<p>But besides the public teachings of Jesus, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the Sermon on the Mount and the parables, there were
other great truths of the gospel that could not be given
to the people, for they were not ready for them and could
not understand them. We can see how the common
people were puzzled by his words about "the bread of
life." Jesus saw that it was needful for him to take the
twelve disciples apart by themselves, that he might
teach them some of the deeper truths of his gospel. In
Galilee he could not be alone with these men; for wherever
he might go there would always be many sick people
coming to be cured and others leading men held in the
power of evil spirits begging Jesus to cast them out.
Then, too, in every place were the Pharisees and scribes,
bringing their questions, asking for miracles, and trying
to stir up the people against Jesus. Wherever Jesus
was, a crowd was always around him, and he could find
no time to teach his disciples some truths needful for
them to know.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to go away from Galilee to
some quiet place where no one would know of his coming.
On the northwest of Galilee was a narrow land, on the
other side of the Lebanon mountains, beside the great
Mediterranean Sea. It was called Ph&oelig;nicia, from the
people who lived there, the Ph&oelig;nicians; and also called
"the land of Tyre and Sidon," from its two leading cities.
The people who lived in that country were not Jews, and
few of them even spoke the Jewish language. Jesus
thought that this would be a quiet place where he could
talk alone with his disciples.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/illus-265.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The woman threw herself at Jesus&#39; feet and cried aloud: &quot;Have mercy on
me, O Lord, son of David!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus and the Twelve quietly left Capernaum, and
walked over the mountains to this land of Tyre and
Sidon. There they found a house and went into it,
intending for a time to live there. Jesus wished nobody
to know of his coming; but he could not be hidden. A
woman of that country heard of him, and at once went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to Jesus, threw herself at his feet, and begged him to
come and cast an evil spirit out of her daughter.</p>

<p>This woman was not of the Jewish people. She was
a foreigner, of a mingled Syrian and Ph&oelig;nician race, a
people called "Canaanites." She cried aloud and kept
on crying:</p>

<p>"Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David! My
little daughter is terribly troubled with an unclean spirit.
Will you not please come and help her?"</p>

<p>At first Jesus did not answer her one word. But his
disciples said to him, "O Master! send this woman away,
for she is making a great noise and disturbing us!" To
them she was only a Gentile, a heathen woman, and the
Jews, even those who followed Jesus, looked with great contempt
on all such people. They did not know that Jesus
was sent to save not only the Jews but also the Gentiles.</p>

<p>Jesus wished to teach his disciples a lesson, that a
Gentile could have the same faith as a Jew. He said to
the woman:</p>

<p>"I was not sent to your people, but only to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel."</p>

<p>But the woman kept on following him. She knelt
down before Jesus, and said, "Master, help me!"</p>

<p>He said to her, "Let the children be satisfied first
of all; it is not fair to take the children's bread and throw
it to the dogs."</p>

<p>"That is true, Lord," said the woman; "yet the little
dogs under the table do pick up some of the children's
crumbs."</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, your faith is
great. Your prayer is granted as you wish. The evil
spirit is gone away from your daughter."</p>

<p>The woman believed the word of Jesus. She hastened
to her home and found her daughter well and resting upon
her bed.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>




<h2>In the Land of the Ten Cities</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Chapter 45</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS SOON found that if he wished to be alone with
his disciples, he must leave the land of Tyre and
Sidon; for after he had cured the woman's child of
her evil spirit, the people were coming to him for other
mighty works. He made up his mind to go farther away,
and taking his disciples, he went to Sidon, north of Tyre,
and then not through Galilee, but around it, to the river
Jordan, north of the Sea of Galilee. He crossed the
Jordan, and on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee came
to a country called Decapolis, or "the land of the Ten
Cities," from ten large places in that region. While they
were on this journey, few people saw them, and as they
walked together he talked to his disciples and taught them
many things.</div>

<p>The place to which Jesus came was not far from the
town where some months before he had cast out from a
poor man a whole army of evil spirits and had sent them
into the drove of hogs. At that time, you remember, the
people had come to Jesus and had begged him to go away
from them, for they had seen his power, but knew nothing
of his goodness. But after that miracle, the man who had
been cured went all through this land of the Ten Cities,
telling the people everywhere of the good work Jesus had
done to him and how much they had lost in sending him
away.</p>

<p>On this second visit of Jesus to this land, the people
were ready and eager for his coming. They gathered
around Jesus with great joy, and came from near and from
far to see him. He went up into a mountain and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
down with his disciples, hoping to be alone. But the
people came to him in great crowds, bringing with them
those that were lame, and ill with different diseases.
They laid these suffering people at his feet, and asked him
to cure them. He made them all well. They all wondered,
as they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made
sound, the lame walking about and the blind seeing;
and they all praised the God of Israel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-269.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">View of Tyre</span>
</div>

<p>At this time they led to Jesus a man who was very
deaf, and who stammered so that people could scarcely
understand his words. They asked Jesus to place his
hand on this man and cure him. But Jesus would not do
this in public, with a crowd of people looking on. He led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
him away out of the throng to a place where they could
be by themselves. He put his fingers into the man's
ears, and then, moistening one finger upon his own tongue,
with it touched the man's tongue. Looking up to heaven
with a sigh, he said, "Be opened." The man's ears and
his tongue were at once set free; he could hear and could
speak plainly. Jesus forbade the man and his friends
to tell anyone about the cure; but contrary to his command
they made it known everywhere. All who saw
this man were astonished; and they said of Jesus, "He
has done everything well! He makes even the deaf to
hear and the dumb to speak!"</p>

<p>The crowd clung to Jesus and followed him for three
days. By that time whatever food the people had brought
with them had been eaten and yet they stayed with Jesus,
never thinking of their needs. Jesus called his disciples
together and said to them:</p>

<p>"My heart is touched on account of all these people;
for they have now been with me three days and they have
nothing to eat. Some of them have come from distant
places, and I cannot bear to send them away hungry for
fear that they may break down by the way."</p>

<p>"Where can we," the disciples asked him, "in a
lonely place like this, with no towns near, find bread for
such a crowd as this?"</p>

<p>"How many loaves have you?" asked Jesus.</p>

<p>"We have in all seven loaves," they answered, "and
with them a few small fishes."</p>

<p>Jesus told all the crowds to sit down upon the ground;
and when they had done so, he held up the loaves and the
fishes, and gave thanks to his heavenly Father for them.
Then he broke the loaves into pieces, also the dried fish,
and gave them to the disciples. The disciples distributed
them among the people; and everyone had all that he
wanted to eat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>After the meal, the disciples went around with large
baskets, and picked up of the food left over seven baskets
full. At this time the people who were fed by Jesus were
four thousand men, besides women and children. When
all were satisfied, Jesus told them to go back to their
homes; then with his disciples, he went into the boat
and sailed across the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<h2>Again on the Sea of Galilee</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 46</div>


<div class='cap'>FROM THE land of the Ten Cities, Jesus and his
disciples sailed straight across the Sea of Galilee,
and on its southwestern shore they came to a city
called Magadan or Magdala. One of the women who
went with Jesus on his journeys in Galilee, Mary Magdalene,
that is, Mary of Magdala, was from this city. Jesus
came to this place for rest and for quiet talking with his
disciples; but as soon as he landed he was met by some
Pharisees and others who did not believe in him. They
said to him:</div>

<p>"Teacher, show us some sign from heaven that you
are a prophet or one whom God has sent."</p>

<p>They wished Jesus to do some miracle or wonderful
work, not that they might believe in him, but only that
they might see what he could do. Everywhere the Pharisees,
who looked upon themselves as leaders, were opposed
to Jesus and stirred up the ignorant people against him.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Jesus never gave any cures
or wonderful works merely to be looked upon. He would
help those who were in need or in trouble; but he would
not merely satisfy an idle desire to see a miracle. He
answered these Pharisees as he had answered others:</p>

<p>"I will give you a sign from heaven. In the evening,
at sunset you say, 'It will be fine weather, for the sky is
as red as fire.' But in the morning, if the sky is red,
you say, 'It will be a stormy day, for the sky is red as
fire, and threatening.' You learn to read the signs in the
sky, yet you do not know how to read the signs of the
times. If you would look, you might see whether I come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from God or not. It is a wicked and a disobedient
people who continually ask for signs. No sign shall be
given to this people, except the sign of the prophet
Jonah."</p>

<p>He did not even tell them how Jonah was to be a
sign or token to them. Perhaps a few months later, when
these people heard that Jesus had been slain and buried;
then after three days had risen again to life, just as
Jonah had come forth alive after being buried for three
days in the great fish, they would then understand how
Jonah had been as a sign of Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus saw at once that this was no place to find quiet
and a chance to teach his disciples, so he went into the
boat again, with his disciples, and sailed away up the
lake. They left in such haste that the disciples did not
think, while they were ashore, to buy some bread, and
they had with them in the boat only one loaf for Jesus
and twelve men.</p>

<p>While they were rowing over the sea, Jesus said to
them:</p>

<p>"Take care and be on your guard against the leaven
of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."</p>

<p>They thought that he was speaking to them about
their having failed to bring more bread, and they began
talking among themselves. Jesus noticed this, and he said:</p>

<p>"Why are you talking to one another about your
being short of bread? How little trust you have in me!
Do you not remember the five loaves with which I fed
the five thousand, and the twelve baskets full of pieces
that you picked up afterward? Have you forgotten about
the seven loaves among the four thousand, and the seven
baskets full that you picked up? How is it that you do
not see that I was not speaking to you about bread?
No, be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees
and the leaven of Herod."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>In warning his disciples against the leaven of the
Pharisees, Jesus meant their pride and pretense of religion
and exactness in obeying rules, while failing to serve
God with the heart. By the leaven of Herod, he meant
the spirit of living for the world, of guilty pleasure, without
a thought of doing God's will.</p>

<p>They came to Bethsaida; and as soon as the people
saw Jesus they brought to him a blind man and begged
him to touch him, hoping to see Jesus give him his sight.
But Jesus would not let them look on the curing of the
man. He took him away from the crowd, and outside
the town, to a lonely place. There, after spitting upon the
man's eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him:</p>

<p>"Can you see anything?"</p>

<p>The man looked up, and said, "Yes, I can see a little,
but not very clearly. I see men moving about, but they
look like trees."</p>

<p>Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes. He
looked around, and now could see everything distinctly.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "Now go directly to your home;
and do not go into the town, where men will see you and
ask how you received your sight."</p>

<p>Jesus and his disciples did not stop in Bethsaida;
for he felt that he must find some quiet, lonely place,
where he could teach his disciples the great truths of
which they knew nothing; truths, too, which it would
be hard for them to believe and to understand. So from
Bethsaida he went on, following a road beside the river
Jordan to the foot of Mount Hermon, far in the north.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Great Confession</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 47</div>


<div class='cap'>FROM BETHSAIDA by the Sea of Galilee Jesus led
his twelve disciples northward, to the very end of
the land of Israel, at the foot of Mount Hermon.
Here, at one of the great springs from which the river
Jordan flows, was the city of Cæsarea-Philippi, or
"Philip's Cæsarea," so called because it was in the land
ruled by Herod Philip, the brother of Herod Antipas,
who was ruling in Galilee. Jesus did not go into the city
of Cæsarea-Philippi, but into one of the villages near the
city, for he wished not to have a crowd around him, but
to be alone with his disciples.</div>

<p>The time had now come for the disciples to
know more about Jesus, who he was, the work that
he was to do and what he was soon to suffer. His
plan of teaching them was not to tell them, but to
lead them on by questions so that they might learn
the truth by finding it out themselves. One day,
after he had been alone praying to his Father, he
asked his disciples:</p>

<p>"Tell me, who do the people say that I am?"</p>

<p>"Some say that you are John the Baptist,
raised up from the dead," answered the disciples;
"others say that you are Elijah the prophet come
to earth again; and still others say that you are
the prophet Jeremiah or some other one of the old
prophets."</p>

<p>"But you, who do you say that I am?" asked Jesus.</p>

<p>At once Simon Peter answered, for he was the one
among the Twelve always ready to speak:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/illus-276.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;But you, who do you say that I am?&quot; asked Jesus of Simon Peter.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of the
living God!"</p>

<p>You know that the Jews everywhere were looking
for a king to rule over them, set them free from the
Roman power and make of them a great conquering
nation. This king, in their own language, they called
"the Messiah," which means, "the Anointed One," for
in Israel a new king was chosen by having oil poured upon
his head. The word "Messiah," in the Greek language,
which was spoken everywhere, was "Christ," also meaning
"The Anointed One." Peter, in speaking those
words, "Thou art the Messiah, the Christ," meant to
say that Jesus was the King of Israel, for whom all the
people were looking.</p>

<p>"You are a blessed man, Simon, son of Jonah,"
answered Jesus, "for no human being has made this
known to you, but my Father who is in heaven. Yes,
and I say to you, 'Your name is Peter&mdash;a Rock&mdash;and
on this rock I will build my church; and all the powers
of the underworld shall not succeed against it.' Also,
Simon Peter, I will give to you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth shall be forbidden
in heaven, and whatever you allow on earth shall
be allowed in heaven."</p>

<p>Because Simon Peter was the first to make this
confession of Jesus as the Messiah-Christ, the King, he
was given special honor among the followers of the
Lord. You remember that more than a year before,
when Jesus met Simon for the first time, beside the river
Jordan, he gave him the new name Peter, which means
"a rock."</p>

<p>Then Jesus told the disciples that they were not to
speak to any of the people of what Peter had said, that
Jesus was the Christ, the King, for the time had not yet
come to make it public. But now, since they knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
he was to be a king and rule over Israel, he began for the
first time to speak of certain other things, which they
found very hard to understand.</p>

<p>"Very soon," said Jesus, "we are going up to Jerusalem;
and there I must endure great suffering from the
rulers of the people, the chief priests and teachers of the
law. I must be slain and buried; and on the third day I
shall rise again."</p>

<p>The disciples could not understand how if he was to
reign as King of Israel, it could be possible for him to
suffer these things and to die. Peter took Jesus aside,
where he could speak with him alone.</p>

<p>"Master," said Peter, "you must not speak of such
things. God will not allow these things to come to you.
You are not going to be put to death in Jerusalem; you
are going to Jerusalem to sit on the throne of David,
and reign over the land!"</p>

<p>But Jesus turned his back upon Peter, and looking
upon his disciples, said:</p>

<p>"Get away from me, Satan! You would turn me
away from doing God's will! For you look at things, not
as God looks at them, but as man does!"</p>

<p>Jesus saw that in Peter's mind was the view of the
kingdom that Satan had shown him in his great temptation
on the mountain, not as a kingdom of God, but as
a kingdom such as men were expecting, a kingdom like
those of the world.</p>

<p>Then Jesus called to his disciples, and to the people
that were around them, and said:</p>

<p>"If any man has the will to come after me and be
my disciple, let him give up his own will, and take up his
cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life
will lose it, and whoever for my sake loses his life shall
find it. What good will it do to a man to gain the whole
world if in gaining he loses his own life? What will a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
man give that is worth as much as his life? For the Son
of Man is coming in the glory of his Father with his
angels; and then he will give to every man what his acts
deserve. And I tell you truly, there are some standing
here who will not die until they have seen the Son of Man
coming to reign in his kingdom."</p>

<h2>The Vision on the Mountain</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 48</div>


<div class='cap'>AT ONE time while Jesus was staying in one of the
villages at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the far
north of the land, he took with him three of his
disciples, Peter, James and John, and went up the
mountain to pray. It was in the afternoon, when they
walked up the mountain, and when night came on he was
still in prayer. The three disciples were tired from climbing
the mountain and fell asleep for a little time. When
they awoke they were filled with wonder at the change
which had come over their Lord.</div>

<p>Although it was night, they saw the face of Jesus
shining as brightly as the sun at noon, with a dazzling
glory so great that they could not bear to look upon him.
His clothes too were shining white and glittering. Not
only his face, but his hands, his feet and even his body
beamed through his garments with brightness.</p>

<p>They saw standing beside Jesus in his splendor two
men who had lived long before on the earth and were
now living no more. How the disciples knew them we
are not told. Perhaps the knowledge flashed upon their
minds, given them by God; or it may have been that
as they listened to these two men, they learned from their
words who they were. One was the great prophet Moses,
who led the Israelites out of Egypt and died on Mount
Nebo; the other was the prophet Elijah, who spoke bold
words to the wicked King Ahab and was taken up to
heaven in a chariot of fire. Both these men had passed
from earth many hundred years before.</p>

<p>As the three disciples looked and listened, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hear what these two prophets of the old times were saying.
They were talking to Jesus about his death which was
to take place at Jerusalem. So these two great men of
the past knew already what Jesus had tried to tell his
disciples, and what they were so slow to believe, that he
was soon to die!</p>

<p>Peter was always eager to speak, and he spoke now,
though he scarcely understood what his own words meant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-282.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Mount Hermon&mdash;the Mount of the Transfiguration</span>
</div>

<p>"Master," he said, "this is a good place for us to
stay in. If you are willing, I will make here three tents;
one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</p>

<p>He thought that the two prophets, Moses and Elijah,
had come back to stay upon the earth; and that if tents
were made for them, they would live upon that mountain.</p>

<p>While Peter was speaking a bright and glorious
cloud came over them all, over Jesus, over the two prophets
and over the three disciples, who were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
fear as they found the cloud around them. And a greater
fear came upon them as they heard the voice of God
out of the cloud saying:</p>

<p>"This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.
Listen to him!"</p>

<p>And as they heard these words, knowing that God had
spoken them, they fell down upon their faces in great terror.
Jesus came to them and touched them gently, saying:</p>

<p>"Rise up, and do not be afraid."</p>

<p>Then they looked up. The bright cloud had passed
away, the two prophets were no longer to be seen, and
Jesus was standing alone over them, some of the glory
still remaining upon his face.</p>

<p>As they were walking down the mountain, Jesus
said to his three disciples, Peter, James and John:</p>

<p>"Tell no one what you have seen this night, until
the Son of Man has risen from the dead."</p>

<p>So, much as they wished to tell their fellow-disciples
of this wonderful sight, they obeyed their Master, and
said not a word about it while Jesus was still with them.</p>

<p>They said to Jesus, "How is it that the teachers of
the law say that the prophet Elijah must come before
the Messiah-King appears?"</p>

<p>"Elijah does come," answered Jesus, "and he prepares
the way for the coming of the King. And I tell
you that Elijah has already come, but the people have not
known him. They would not listen to him, and have
done to him as they pleased. And just as it was with
him, so will it be with the Son of Man. He shall also
suffer at the hands of men."</p>

<p>Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking
to them of John the Baptist, who like Elijah had lived
in the wilderness, wore a mantle of skin, and fed on desert-food,
and who, like Elijah, gave God's message to the
people, preparing the way for the coming of Jesus Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Boy with the Dumb Spirit</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 49</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN JESUS and his three disciples came to the
village at the foot of the mountain, they found
a great crowd gathered around the other nine
disciples, and some of the Jewish teachers of the law, the
scribes, talking with them very earnestly. Some of the
glory of the last night still lingered upon the face of Jesus,
and as the people looked upon him, they were filled with
wonder and bowed down before him.</div>

<p>Out of the crowd came a man running, whose face
showed that he was in great trouble. He knelt before
Jesus and cried out:</p>

<p>"Teacher, I brought to you my son, in whom is an
evil spirit, which has made him dumb. I pray you have
mercy on him, and cure him, for he is my only child.
Often the spirit seizes him and dashes him down. It
makes him foam at the mouth and grind his teeth. He
is wasting away, and I fear will die unless help comes to
him. I brought him here, hoping to find you. But
you were away, and I spoke to these men, your disciples.
They tried to cast out the evil spirit, but they could not.
Now that you have come, will you not help me?"</p>

<p>"O you people who will not believe, and who turn
away from God!" said Jesus, "how long must I be with
you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring
your boy to me."</p>

<p>They brought the boy to Jesus; but no sooner did
the boy see him, than the wicked spirit threw him into a
spasm. He fell on the ground, his body twitching and
tearing; and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long has he been like this?" asked Jesus of the
boy's father.</p>

<p>"Ever since he was a little child," the man answered,
"and it has many times thrown him into fire and into
water, almost killing him. If you can do anything, do
take pity on us both and help us."</p>

<p>"'If I can!'" said Jesus, taking up the man's word.
"Do you not know that all things can be done for the one
who believes?"</p>

<p>"I do believe," cried out the father of the boy.
"O Master, help my lack of faith!"</p>

<p>Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering around,
and he spoke to the evil spirit.</p>

<p>"Deaf and dumb spirit," he said, "I command you
at once come out of this boy, and never again trouble
him!"</p>

<p>With a loud cry, the evil spirit threw the boy into a
violent spasm of pain and then left him. The boy lay
on the ground, looking like a corpse. In fact, many who
were standing near, as they saw him, said, "The boy is
surely dead!"</p>

<p>But Jesus took his hand, lifting him from the ground.
The boy stood up and walked away well, free from the
evil spirit and able to speak.</p>

<p>When Jesus was alone with his disciples in the house,
they asked him, "Why was it that we could not drive
out the evil spirit from the boy?"</p>

<p>"It was because you have so little faith. I tell you
that if your faith were only the size of a grain of mustard-seed,
you could say to this mountain, 'Move from this
place to that,' and move it would; for nothing would
be impossible to you."</p>

<p>But he added, "An evil spirit of this kind is harder
to drive away than most. Only by special prayer can it
be cast out."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this Jesus left that place at the foot of
the mountain, and led his disciples toward the south.
They saw that he was now going in the direction of
Jerusalem, and were quite sure that there he would set
up his throne and kingdom. But Jesus knew what they
were thinking of, and he said to them,</p>

<p>"Listen carefully to my words. The Son of Man is
to be given into the hands of his enemies. They shall
kill him, and three days after he has been killed, he shall
rise again to life."</p>

<p>But the disciples could not understand these words,
for they would not believe that he was to die, and they
were afraid to ask him what these sayings meant.</p>

<h2>The Last Visit to Capernaum</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 50</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was passing through Galilee for
the last time, he wished not to do in that land
any more wonderful works or to give any further
teachings in public. He desired not to have crowds
around him, but to be alone with his disciples, for there
were many things to be told them before he should be
taken away from them.</div>

<p>As they were on their way to Capernaum, which
had been his home during the year before, he saw that
his disciples as they walked were having some dispute or
quarrel. He well knew what they were saying to each
other, for he knew all things; but at the time he said
nothing.</p>

<p>He came to Capernaum, for the first time followed by
no crowd, but with his twelve disciples only. In the evening,
as they sat together in the house, he said to them:</p>

<p>"What was it that you were talking about today
as we were walking on the road?"</p>

<p>The disciples looked at each other, a little ashamed,
and at first did not speak. Finally, one of them said:</p>

<p>"We were asking each other who of us should hold
the first place in your kingdom."</p>

<p>Although Jesus had more than once told these men
that he must suffer and die, they did not believe it. They
saw that he was on his way toward Jerusalem, and like
all the people who believed in him, they thought that
when he came to that city, he would take his kingdom and
rule; and each of his disciples wanted a place for himself
next the throne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"The first place!" answered Jesus. "If any of you
has the will to be first in the kingdom of heaven, that one
shall be the last of all and shall serve all the others!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/illus-289.jpg" width="312" height="400" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Whoever will become like this little child, shall be
the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven</span>
</div>

<p>A little child was playing near him, for the children
were never afraid of Jesus and loved to be with him.
Jesus reached out his hand, took the child in his arms and
held it close to him. Then he said to his disciples:</p>

<p>"I tell you, unless
you change your
spirit and become
like little children,
you will not enter
into the kingdom of
heaven at all! Whoever
of you will become
humble and
gentle, like this little
child, not seeking
great things for
himself, that is the
one who shall be
the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven.
And any one who
helps even a little
child to be one of
my followers is
helping me. But if
anyone puts a snare or stumbling-block in the way of one
of these little ones, to keep him from following me, it
would be better for that man to have a great millstone
hung on his neck, and to be thrown into the deep sea!
Woe to the world on account of snares and hindrances,
keeping men away from God and from salvation! There
must be these snares and hindrances, that cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
helped; but woe to the man who puts them in the
way!</p>

<p>"If your hand or your foot becomes a snare to you,
keeping you from God, you must cut it off and throw it
away. It is better for you to enter into life a cripple,
and with only one hand, than with two hands or two
feet, to go away to everlasting death. And if your eye
would lead you to forsake God, pluck it out and throw it
away. It is better for you to be saved having only one
eye, than to be lost having two eyes.</p>

<p>"I tell you, never despise or think lightly of one of
these little ones; for I say to you, their angels always
see the face of my Father who is in heaven."</p>

<p>Then John, one of the disciples, said:</p>

<p>"Teacher, we saw a man who is not one of your
followers using your name to cast out evil spirits; and
we told him not to use your name, since he is not with us."</p>

<p>"Do not forbid him," said Jesus, "there is no man
who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able also
to speak against me. Whoever is not against us is for
us. Why, if any one will give you even a cup of water
to drink, because you belong to Christ, I tell you truly,
that man shall not fail of having a reward."</p>

<p>At that time Jesus told his disciples how to treat
those who had done them any wrong. He said:</p>

<p>"If your brother does wrong, go to him and speak
to him about it when you are alone with him. If he
listens to you, then you have won your brother. But
if he will not listen, take with you one or two others,
and talk with him again, that there may be at least two
witnesses in every case. If he will not listen to these
men, speak to the church; and if he refuses to listen to
the church, then have nothing more to do with him, but
treat him as a stranger, as the people treat those who
collect the taxes for the Romans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, my disciples, that whatever you forbid
on earth shall be forbidden by those in heaven; and
whatever you allow on earth shall be allowed by those
in heaven. I tell you another thing: if two of you shall
agree on earth upon anything that they ask in prayer,
it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
For where two or three have come together in my name,
I am there among them."</p>

<p>Then Peter came up to Jesus and asked him a question.
It was this:</p>

<p>"Master, how often should I forgive my brother
when he has done me wrong? Shall it be as many as
seven times?"</p>

<p>"Seven times?" said Jesus. "No, I say, seventy
times seven! For the kingdom of heaven may be compared
to a king who wished to have his servants pay
him the debts which they owed him. When he had
begun to make up their accounts, one servant was
brought before him who owed him more than a million
dollars. He could not pay his debt, and his master
ordered that he should be sold, and his wife and
children with him, and everything that he had, toward
the payment of his debt. The servant fell down upon
his face before him, and said, 'Only have patience
with me, my lord, and I will pay it all.' His master
knew that he could never pay so great a debt; he felt
a pity for him, and let him go free, forgiving him all
that he owed.</p>

<p>"But as he was going away, that servant met one
of his fellow-servants who owed him a small debt, only
about fifteen dollars. He took him by the throat, and
said, 'Pay me what you owe me!' The man threw
himself on the ground and begged for mercy, crying out,
'Have patience with me, wait a little while, and I will
pay all that I owe you.' But he refused to have mercy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he took him into the court and had him put into prison
until he should pay the debt.</p>

<p>"When the other servants saw him sending this
man to prison, they felt troubled and told the king
what he had done. At this the king became very angry.
He sent for that cruel servant and said to him, 'You
wicked servant! When you asked me for mercy, I gave
to you all your great debt and let you go free! Should
not you, also, have shown the same kindness to your
fellow-servant that I showed to you?' Then his master,
being very angry, handed him over to the jailor, to be
kept in a dungeon until he should pay the whole of
his debt. So also will my Father in heaven do to you,
unless you forgive your brother with all your heart."</p>

<p>While Jesus was at this time in Capernaum, the
officer who collected from the Jews the tax for the
Temple came to Peter and said:</p>

<p>"Does not your Master pay the Temple tax?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Peter.</p>

<p>But when he went into the house, before he could
speak, Jesus said to him,</p>

<p>"Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings of this
world take taxes? From their sons, or from foreigners?"</p>

<p>"From foreigners," answered Peter.</p>

<p>"Then their own people are free from being taxed,
are they not? We are the sons of God, and we should
be free from the tax for the house of God. However, in
order not to displease them, do you go to the sea, throw
in a hook and take the first fish that comes up; open
its mouth, and you will find in it a piece of silver money.
Take that and give it to the tax collectors for you
and me."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>




<h2>Good-bye to Galilee</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 51</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was still in Capernaum, the fall
of the year came on, and with it the time
drew near for the Jewish Feast of Tents, or
Feast of Tabernacles. In the Bible, the word "tabernacles"
always means "tents." This feast was called
"the Feast of the Tents" because every year the people
who went up to Jerusalem to attend it lived for a week
in little tents or huts made of green branches; to keep
in mind the forty years, long before, when, after coming
out of Egypt, the Israelites lived in the desert in tents,
moving from place to place.</div>

<p>The younger brothers of Jesus, the sons of Joseph
and Mary, heard that Jesus was in Capernaum; and
they came to see him. At this time these brothers of
Jesus did not believe in him as their King and Saviour;
although afterward they were among his followers.
These men said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"Why do you not go to Judea and Jerusalem and
let your disciples see there what you can do? No one
who wishes to be known stays in a place apart from
the people. Since you can do these great works, you
should show yourself to the world."</p>

<p>"My time," said Jesus, "has not come yet; but
your time is always here. The world is not against
you, but it is against me, because I speak against its
evil deeds. Go yourselves up to the feast; I am not
going as yet up to this feast, because my time has not
yet come."</p>

<p>Jesus did not wish to have as his companions at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the feast men who did not believe in him, even though
they were his brothers. So, while his brothers went on
to Jerusalem, he stayed a little longer in Galilee. Before
he left the city of Capernaum he gave one last call and
warning to its people and those in the cities near by.
He spoke to those who lived in Chorazin, a town only
a few miles from Capernaum; and those in Bethsaida,
five miles away, at the head of the lake. He said to
these cities:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-294.jpg" width="500" height="354" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Christ&#39;s call to the sick and weary: &quot;Come unto me, all ye who labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Woe unto you, Chorazin! and woe to you, Bethsaida!
If the mighty works that were done in you
had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, long
before this time they would have turned from sin to
God, weeping in rough garments, with ashes on their
heads! I tell you that when God comes to judge the
lands, it will be harder for Chorazin and Bethsaida than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
for Tyre and Sidon. And you, O Capernaum, shall you
be lifted up to heaven? No, you will sink down to
death. For if the great works that were done in you
had been done in Sodom, that city would have lasted
until today. But I say to you, it will be easier for
Sodom in God's day of judgment than for you, O
Capernaum!"</p>

<p>At the same time Jesus spoke these words also:</p>

<p>"I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, for hiding these things from the wise and the
learned, and for making them known to those who are
child-like in spirit. Yes, Father, I praise thee that this
has been the way that thou hast chosen.</p>

<p>"All power has been given to me by the Father;
and no one can fully know the Son except the Father;
and no one fully knows the Father except the Son, and
he to whom the Son will make him known.</p>

<p>"Come unto me, all ye who labor and are heavy-laden
with your troubles; and I will give you rest.
Take upon you the yoke that I bear, and learn from
me how to live; for I am gentle and lowly-minded, and
you shall find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy
and my load is light."</p>

<p>With these words Jesus left Capernaum and Galilee
for the last time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<h2>Passing Through Samaria</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 52</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER MOST of those who were going up to Jerusalem
for the Feast of Tents had left Capernaum,
Jesus began his journey with his disciples. All
who saw him going toward Jerusalem, and even his
disciples, thought that now he was surely on his way
to take his throne and rule the people as king of Israel.</div>

<p>Just as they were starting, a man who was one
of the teachers of the law came to Jesus and said:</p>

<p>"Master, I will follow you wherever you may go."
He thought that by following Jesus he might have some
high place in his kingdom. But Jesus saw that this
man was following him only for gain. He said to him:</p>

<p>"You will gain nothing by following me. The foxes
have holes, and the wild birds have their nests; but
the Son of Man has not a place where he can lay his
head."</p>

<p>To another man, Jesus said, "Follow me!" The
man answered, "First let me go and bury my father."</p>

<p>Jesus said to this man, "Let those who are dead
bury their dead; but do you go and spread everywhere
the news of the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>Jesus meant by this that such matters as the burial
of the dead could be cared for by others, even though
they did not have a knowledge of the truth which gives
life; but Jesus wanted this man to go at once and
preach his gospel.</p>

<p>There was another man who said to Jesus, "I will
follow you; but let me first go and say 'good-bye' to
my friends at my home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whoever looks back," answered Jesus, "after he
has put his hand to the plough is of no use for the
kingdom of God."</p>

<p>For his work Jesus wanted men who were single-hearted,
giving up all, that they might follow and serve
him.</p>

<p>On this journey to Jerusalem Jesus did not take
the road down the Jordan valley, the way usually followed.
He made up his mind this time to go through
Samaria, perhaps because he did not wish to have a
crowd of people with him, and few of the Jews went
to Jerusalem by way of Samaria.</p>

<p>As he drew near a Samaritan village, he sent some
of his disciples to find in it a lodging place. But the
Samaritan people would not allow Jesus and his disciples
to come into their village, because they saw that
they were Jews on their way to Jerusalem. The Samaritans
and the Jews hated each other and would not show
kindness to one another.</p>

<p>James and John, two of the disciples, were exceedingly
angry at these people, who would shut out their
Master. They said to him:</p>

<p>"Lord, shall we call down fire from heaven, as the
prophet Elijah did, and burn up that wicked village?"</p>

<p>But Jesus said to them, "Your spirit is not right.
I did not come to destroy the lives of men, but to save
them. Let us go to some other village."</p>

<p>While he was still on the border of Galilee and
Samaria, as he was going into a village, he met ten men
who had the terrible disease of leprosy. They stood at
a distance, for lepers were not allowed to come near
people; and they cried aloud, saying:</p>

<p>"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"</p>

<p>"Go," answered Jesus, "and show yourselves to
the priests."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Temple was a room where a man went who
had any disease like leprosy, with a breaking out upon
his skin. At this room he was kept for a time; and
if it was found that his disease was not leprosy, after
certain offerings and washings, he was allowed to go
home and be among men. These men started for their
Temple; those who were Jews for the Temple in Jerusalem,
any that were Samaritans for their Temple on
Mount Gerizim, near the city of Shechem. As they
went, and by going showed their faith in Jesus, they
found all at once that their leprosy was gone and they
were entirely well.</p>

<p>Nine of these ten men, after they were cured, went
on their way toward the Temple. But one of them,
when he found that he was a leper no longer, stopped
with a loud voice praised God; and ran to Jesus' feet
and fell on his face before him, giving him thanks for
his cure. This man was a Samaritan.</p>

<p>"Were there not ten men cured?" said Jesus.
"But where are the nine? Was there only one to turn
back and give thanks to God, and that one a stranger?"</p>

<p>And Jesus said to this grateful Samaritan, "Rise
up, and go your way; your faith has made you well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Scribe's Question; and
Mary's Choice</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 53</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was on his way to Jerusalem one
of the teachers of the law&mdash;whom the Jews
called "scribes"&mdash;came to him with a question.
These Jewish scribes were everywhere enemies of Jesus,
and were continually asking him questions, not that
they might learn, but that in some way they might
give him trouble.</div>

<p>This scribe said to Jesus, "Teacher, what shall I
do that I may have the life everlasting?"</p>

<p>"What is said in God's law?" answered Jesus.
"What do you read there?"</p>

<p>He answered, "You must love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
strength, and with all your mind; and you must love
your neighbor as yourself."</p>

<p>"That is a right answer," said Jesus; "do that and
you shall live."</p>

<p>But the scribe, wishing to make an excuse for himself,
and thinking to puzzle Jesus, said, "But who is
my neighbor?"</p>

<p>Then Jesus told to this man the parable or story
of "The Good Samaritan."</p>

<p>"There was once a man," said Jesus, "who was
going down by a lonely road from Jerusalem to Jericho.
The robbers who hide among the mountains in that
region rushed at this man, stripped him of everything,
and beat him near to death; then ran away and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
him almost dead on the roadside. It happened that a
priest was going down the same road. He saw the
man lying there, but instead of coming to help him,
walked past him on the other side of the road. Then
a Levite, one of those who help the priests in the services
of the Temple, came to that place; and he too went by
on the other side, carefully keeping away from the
suffering man.</p>

<p>"But soon after, a Samaritan, one of those people
whom all the Jews hate and despise, came down the
same road. This man, when he found the poor man
lying in the road, got off from the ass on which he was
riding and stood over the man. He felt a pity for the
sufferer and put bandages on his wounds, after pouring
into them a little oil and wine. Then he lifted up the
man and carefully placed him on his own ass, and
walking by his side, brought him to an inn and cared
for him all that night. On the next morning he took
out from his purse two pieces of silver, handed them
to the inn-keeper and said to him, 'Look after this
man until he is well; and if you spend more than this,
I will repay it to you when I come this way again.'</p>

<p>"Now," asked Jesus, "which one of these three men,
the priest, the Levite and the Samaritan, do you think
showed himself a true neighbor to the poor fellow who
fell among the robbers?"</p>

<p>The scribe answered, "The one who showed kindness
to him."</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "Then go and do as this man
did." He meant to show the scribe that "our neighbor"
is the one who most needs our help, whoever he may be.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/illus-303.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Martha, Martha,&quot; replied the Lord, &quot;you are anxious and troubled about a
great many things.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem, he did not at
once enter the city and find a lodging place within its
walls, for he knew well that it was filled with his enemies;
and that the priests and rulers would try to seize him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and put him to death. He expected after some months
to die at Jerusalem, as he had so many times told his
disciples&mdash;although they could not believe it&mdash;but the
time for his death had not yet come. For a home while
attending the Feast of Tents, he went to a village about
two miles from Jerusalem, on the east of the Mount of
Olives. This village was called Bethany, and in it was
living a family all of whom were strong friends of Jesus:
Martha, her sister Mary and their younger brother
Lazarus. With this family he stayed while he was visiting
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Martha was the older sister and the head of the
house. She gave Jesus a hearty welcome and made
herself busy in attending to his needs. But Mary, her
younger sister, left everything and seated herself at the
feet of the Lord, eager to listen to his words. Martha,
somewhat worried by her many cares, especially in making
ready a dinner for Jesus, was not pleased at her
sister's conduct. She came to Jesus and said:</p>

<p>"Lord, do you think it right for my sister to leave
all the work to me? Tell her to help me."</p>

<p>"Martha, Martha," replied the Lord, "you are
anxious and trouble yourself about a great many things.
Only one thing is really needful. Mary has chosen the
best dish, and she will not be dragged away from it."</p>

<p>Jesus meant to say that Martha need not prepare
a dinner with many dishes, for he needed only a simple
meal; and that Mary had chosen well instead of food
the words that he was speaking, which were really a
feast to her soul.</p>

<p>At one time Jesus was praying in a certain place.
It may have been on the Mount of Olives, between
Bethany and Jerusalem, for Jesus went there often to
pray. When his prayer was over, the disciples came
to him and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Master, John the Baptist taught his disciples how
to pray. Will you not also give us a prayer that we
may use?"</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "I will give you this prayer.
When you pray, say, 'Our Father, who art in heaven;
Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us day
by day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, for ever and forever.
Amen.'"</p>

<p>Jesus also gave to his disciples a parable or story
about earnestness in prayer. He said:</p>

<p>"Suppose that one of you who has a friend should
go to his house in the middle of the night, and should
knock at his door loud enough to wake him from his
sleep, and should say to him, 'Friend, please do get up
and let me have three loaves of bread! A friend of mine
has suddenly come to my house and I have nothing for
him to eat;' and suppose the other should answer him
from inside the door, 'Don't bother me; the door is
locked and I am in bed with my children. I can't get
up and give you anything!' I tell you, though he will
not get up and give you anything merely because you
are a friend of his, if you keep on knocking long enough,
he will at last rise and give you whatever you want,
because you persevere in seeking after it.</p>

<p>"So, I say to you: ask, and the gift shall be yours;
seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door will be
opened to you. For every one who asks, receives; he
that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, the door shall
be opened.</p>

<p>"Is there a father among you, who if his son asks
for bread, will give him a stone? If he is asked for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
fish, will he give his son a snake? Or, if asked for an
egg, will he give him a scorpion? If you then, even not
as good as you should be, are willing to give good things
to your children, how much more will your Father in
heaven give this Holy Spirit to his children that ask
him?"</p>

<h2>Jesus at the Feast of Tents</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 54</div>


<div class='cap'>AT THE TIME when Jesus came to Jerusalem, the
Feast of Tents was half over. Many had been
looking for him, for all through the land he was
talked about. At the Feast the people were saying,
"Where is he? Has he come up to the Feast?"</div>

<p>Some said, "He is a good man." Others said,
"No, he cannot be a good man, for he is leading the
people away from the law of Moses." But no one
spoke freely about him, for fear of the rulers and the
people of Jerusalem whose minds had been set against
Jesus by the priests and the scribes or teachers of the
law.</p>

<p>From his home in Bethany at Martha's house,
Jesus came quietly into the Temple and began teaching
the people who gathered there during the Feast, going
out at evening to Bethany. All who heard him wondered
at his words, and every day the crowds around
him grew. People said to each other, "How did this
man get all his knowledge? He has never studied in
the college of the scribes."</p>

<p>"My teaching," said Jesus in answer, "is not my
own; but it comes from Him who sent me. Any one
who chooses to do God's will, will know whether I speak
in God's name, or whether I am talking in my own name.
Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you honestly
tries to keep the law. If you did try to keep the
law, you would not try to kill me!"</p>

<p>The crowd replied to Jesus, "You are crazy! Who
is trying to kill you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jesus knew that he was speaking the truth,
for he knew what was in the minds of the rulers and of
many in Jerusalem. He said to the crowd:</p>

<p>"I will be with you only a little longer, and then I
am going to him who sent me. You will look for me,
but you will not
find me, and where
I am going, you
cannot come."</p>

<p>"Where is this
man going," said
the Jews, "that we
cannot find him?
Is he going among
our people in foreign
lands, to teach the
foreigners? What
does he mean by
words like these?"</p>

<p>Jesus meant
that after they
should kill him and
he should rise from
the tomb and live
again, he was going
back to his home
in heaven, a place
to which they could
never come.</p>

<img src="images/illus-308.jpg" width="334" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;If any man thirst, let him come unto me
and drink&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The last and greatest day of the Feast of Tents
came. On that day they brought water into the Temple
and poured it out, amid great rejoicing; calling to mind
how God had given water from the rock to the Israelites
in the desert.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pouring out of the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Jesus cried with a very loud voice, so that all heard
him:</p>

<p>"If any one is thirsty," he said, "let him come to
me and drink! He who believes in me, out of him
shall flow rivers of living water!"</p>

<p>Some of the people, when they heard this, said,
"This must be really the Prophet who is to come!"</p>

<p>Others said, "This is the Christ, the King of
Israel!"</p>

<p>But there were those who said, "No, this cannot be
Christ the King, for this man comes from Galilee, and
the Bible says that Christ is to come from the line of
King David and from David's town of Bethlehem."</p>

<p>These people knew that Jesus came to them from
Galilee, but they did not know that he had been born
in Bethlehem and belonged to the royal line of David.
They were divided over Jesus: some thought that he
was their promised king, while others wanted to seize
him as a teacher of falsehood. The rulers sent out
officers to make him their prisoner, but somehow no
man dared to lay hands upon him.</p>

<p>When the officers came back to the chief priests
and leading men, they were asked, "Why did you not
bring this man with you?"</p>

<p>The officers answered, "No man ever spoke as this
man speaks!"</p>

<p>"What! has this man led you astray, too?" said
the rulers. "Have any of the leading men, or the
Pharisees, believed in him? As for this crowd who know
nothing of the law, they are of no account!"</p>

<p>Nicodemus, that one of the rulers who a year before
had come by night to talk with Jesus, said to them:</p>

<p>"Surely our law does not allow any man to be
treated as guilty before hearing what he has to say and
finding out what he has done!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you too from Galilee, like all the followers
of this man?" they answered him. "Search, and you
will find that no prophet ever comes from Galilee."</p>

<p>In the evening all the people went to their homes,
and Jesus went over the Mount of Olives to his friends
at Bethany.</p>

<h2>Jesus and the Sinful Woman</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 55</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE Feast of Tents Jesus stayed near Jerusalem,
making his home in Bethany, for nearly
two months, until another feast came, the Feast
of the Dedication of the Temple. About two hundred
years before that time, the Temple had been held by
enemies, who had stopped the services, had set up
images in the building and had done many things to
make it vile. At last the enemies were driven away;
and then the Jews made the Temple clean again,
destroyed the images and began once more the regular
service. After this, every year they kept the day of
the reopening of the Temple as "The Feast of the
Dedication." At this feast the Temple was lighted up
every night very brightly, and on that account the
feast was also called "The Feast of Lights."</div>

<p>During the days of his stay, Jesus went often to
the Temple and sat down in a room called "The Court
of the Women," because on one side of it was a gallery
where the women worshipped, looking down on the
services at the altar. It was also called "The Treasury"
on account of the gift-boxes on its walls, where people
dropped in their money for the poor and for the support
of the Temple. In this court, which was very
large, and open to the sky, without a roof, the Jewish
teachers held their classes for the study of the law;
and many came to Jesus to listen to his words.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/illus-312.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus replied to the accusers of the sinful woman: &quot;Let the one among you who
has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One morning the teaching of Jesus was interrupted
by a noise in the court. Some of the scribes and
Pharisees, who were enemies of Jesus, planned to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
him into trouble with the Roman rulers. They came,
dragging in a poor woman who had done a wicked deed;
and bringing her forward directly in front of Jesus.</p>

<p>"Teacher," they said, "this woman was caught in
a wicked act. Now, Moses in the law commands that
any person committing that crime shall be stoned to
death; but what do you say should be done with her?"</p>

<p>Jesus very well knew that they had brought this
question to him hoping, whatever he said, to make
trouble for him. If he should say, "Let her go free,"
they would declare that Jesus was a breaker of the
law and cared nothing for crimes. If, on the other
hand, he said, "Let her be punished," they could say
to the Roman rulers, "This man is acting as a judge
and claims to be the King of Israel;" and this might
cause the Romans to put him to death. So, whatever
Jesus might say, they could find some reason to accuse him.</p>

<p>But Jesus seemed to pay no attention to their words.
He stooped down, and began to write with his finger
on the floor. But as they kept on asking him the same
question, finally he rose up, looked his enemies full in
the face, and said:</p>

<p>"Let the one among you who has never done wrong
throw the first stone at her."</p>

<p>Then he stooped down again and continued writing
with his finger. They stood silent for some time and
then began quietly to go away, the oldest men first
and the younger men later. After a while, Jesus looked
up and saw the woman standing alone before him. He
rose up and said:</p>

<p>"Woman, where are those men? Does no man
say that you are guilty?"</p>

<p>She answered him, "No man, Lord."</p>

<p>Jesus said to her, "Neither do I call you guilty.
Go away, and never sin again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jesus went on with his teaching, which had
been stopped by the bringing in of the woman by his
enemies. He said:</p>

<p>"I am the light of the whole world. He who follows
me and
obeys my words
will not walk in
darkness, but
shall have the
light of life."</p>

<p>Many other
things Jesus said
to the people at
that time; and
some of those
who heard him
began to believe
that he was a
teacher come
from God. To
those who believed,
he said:</p>

<p>"If you
stand faithful to
my words, you
are truly my followers;
and you
shall understand the truth, and the truth shall make
you free."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I am the light of the whole world. He who follows
me and obeys my words will not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"What do you mean by those words, 'You shall
be made free'?" said the people. "We are sprung from
Abraham, and have never been slaves. How can we
be made free?"</p>

<p>"In very truth, I tell you," answered Jesus, "every
one who sins is a slave. Now the slave does not stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in the home always, but the son stays, for it is his home,
and he has a right to be there. So, if the Son of the
heavenly Father sets you free from sin, you will be free
indeed."</p>

<p>As Jesus went on speaking, the people who listened
became very angry. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Your great father Abraham longed to see the day
when I should come to the earth; and he saw it coming,
and it made him glad."</p>

<p>"Why," the Jews said, "you are not fifty years old,
and do you say that Abraham saw you?"</p>

<p>"I tell you truly," answered Jesus, "before Abraham
was born, I was living!"</p>

<p>At this, they picked up stones to throw at him;
but Jesus hid himself from them and left the Temple.</p>

<h2>The Blind Man at the Pool
of Siloam</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 56</div>


<div class='cap'>ON A SABBATH morning, which was not Sunday,
but Saturday, the Jewish day of rest and church-going&mdash;Jesus
and his disciples were on their
way to the service in the Temple, when they passed a
blind man. They had seen this man before and knew
that he had been blind all his life. He had come into
the world without eyesight, to the great sorrow of his
father and mother; and he lived upon the little coins
that people gave him as they were on their way to the
Temple.</div>

<p>The Jews believed that every disease was caused
by some act of sin; that if a man became ill, it was
because he had done some wicked deed and was being
punished for it; and if a child was born blind, or dumb,
or crippled, it must have been because either its father
or mother had sinned against God's law. Some of the
scribes, who were the teachers of the law, said that each
soul lived many times on the earth; that when a man
died, his soul went into a body that was born at that
moment; and if the new-born baby was blind, or diseased,
it was because it had done wrong in some life before that
one. None of these things are believed now since Christ
has taught men, but they were held by nearly all people
while Jesus was on the earth.</p>

<p>As the disciples were passing by this blind man, one
of them said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"Teacher, whose sin was it that caused this man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
be born blind? Was it the fault of his parents? Or was
it his own fault?"</p>

<p>"It was through no fault of his, nor of his father
or mother that this man was born blind," answered
Jesus. "It was that God might show a wonderful
work in him. While daylight lasts, we must be
doing God's work; the night will soon come when we
can work no longer. As long as I am in the world I
am the light of the world, and give light to men."</p>

<p>As he said
this, he spat
on the ground
and mixed the
spittle with
dust, making
it into mud,
and smeared
it on the
man's eyes.
He said to
the blind
man:</p>

<p>"Now, go
down to the
pool of Siloam
and wash."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-317.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">The Pool of Siloam at the present time</span>
</div>

<p>The pool of Siloam was a large tank or reservoir on
the southeast of the city, where the valley of the brook
Kedron and the valley of Hinnom meet. To go to that
place the blind man with two great blotches of mud on
his face must walk across the city of Jerusalem, passing
all the crowds on their way to worship. He went down
to the pool of Siloam, climbed down its steps to the water
and washed the mud from his face. In a moment his
white, sightless eyes flashed with a new light. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
up, and for the first time in all his life he could
see!</p>

<p>As he went to his father's house, everybody who
saw him noticed how differently he looked. All had
known him as a blind man, groping his way to the place
where he used to sit as a beggar. The people asked each
other:</p>

<p>"Is this the same blind man that begged in the street?"</p>

<p>Some said, "Yes, this is the same man."</p>

<p>But others said, "No, this cannot be the man; but
he is one who looks somewhat like him."</p>

<p>He said, "I am the same man."</p>

<p>"Then how did you get your sight?" they asked.</p>

<p>"The man whom they call Jesus," he answered,
"made some mud and put it on my eyes, and said, 'Go
to Siloam and wash your eyes.' So I went and washed
them; and my sight came to me."</p>

<p>"Where is this man who cured you?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered.</p>

<p>They took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees,
who were the leaders of the people. We have seen
that the Pharisees were always enemies to Jesus. So
the Pharisees asked him to tell again how he had gained
his sight; and he told them:</p>

<p>"The man named Jesus smeared some mud on my
eyes, and I washed them, and now I can see."</p>

<p>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man Jesus cannot
be from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath."</p>

<p>The scribes had made a rule that mixing up mud on
the Sabbath day was working; that carrying it from one
place to another was bearing a load; and that to give
any treatment to a sick man on the Sabbath, unless it was
necessary to save his life, was Sabbath breaking. So
to their eyes, Jesus in curing the blind man had broken
the Sabbath rules in more than one way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>But some others said, "How can a bad man do such
wonderful works? Is not this work of cure a sign that
God is with him?"</p>

<p>So there were two parties among them in their
opinion about Jesus. They asked the blind man again:</p>

<p>"What do you say of this man who has opened your
eyes?"</p>

<p>"I say that he is a prophet from God," answered the
man.</p>

<p>Many of the Jews, however, would not believe that
this man had been born blind and had gained his sight,
until they sent for his father and mother.</p>

<p>"Is this your son," they asked, "the son you say was
born blind? How is it that now he can see?"</p>

<p>"This is our son," his parents answered, "and he was
born blind; of that we are sure. But how it is that he
can see now, we do not know, nor do we know who opened
his eyes. Ask him&mdash;he is old enough&mdash;he can speak for
himself."</p>

<p>His parents spoke in this way because they were
afraid of the Jews, for the rulers had agreed that any
one who said that Jesus was the Christ should be turned
out of the church. That was why they had said, "He
is old enough; ask him." So the Pharisees again sent
for the man who had been blind, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Give God all the praise for your sight; we know
that this Jesus is a bad man."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about his being a bad man; one
thing I do know, that once I was blind, and now I can
see."</p>

<p>"What did he do to you?" they asked. "How did
he open your eyes?"</p>

<p>"I have told you all about it already," he replied,
"and it seems you do not listen. Why do you want to
hear it again? Do you intend to be his disciples?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they were in a rage at him, and said, "You
may be his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses, and
we obey his laws. We know that God spoke to Moses,
but we do not know where this fellow comes from!"</p>

<p>"Well, this is very strange!" answered the man.
"You do not know where he comes from; and yet he has
opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen
to bad men; but if any man is God-fearing, and does
God's will, that man God will hear. Since the world
began, no one ever heard before of a man that could open
the eyes of one born blind. If this Jesus were not of God,
he could do nothing."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to teach us?" they answered.
"You, who were born a sinner?"</p>

<p>Then they turned him out of the church; they forbade
him to sit in the meetings or to go into the Temple;
and after that none of them would so much as speak to
him. Jesus heard that he had been put out of the church;
he sought him out, and when he had found him, he asked:</p>

<p>"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</p>

<p>"Tell me who he is," said the man, "and I will
believe in him."</p>

<p>"You have seen him," answered Jesus, "and it is
he who is now speaking to you."</p>

<p>The man said, "I do believe, Lord," and he fell
on his face before him.</p>

<p>And Jesus said, "I came into the world to put men
to this test, in order that those who cannot see, and know
they are blind as this man was, might be made to see;
and that those who think they can see should remain
blind."</p>

<p>Some of the Pharisees who heard this knew that it
was a rebuke to them, because they failed to see in
Jesus one sent from God. They said:</p>

<p>"Then are we blind, too!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you were really blind," said Jesus, "you would
have no sin to answer for; but as it is, you say, 'We can
see,' and so your sin remains against you."</p>

<p>Again the Jews were divided over the words of
Jesus. Some said, "He is crazy! Why listen to him?"</p>

<p>But others said, "These are not the words of a
crazy man. Can a man who is crazy open the eyes of a
blind man?"</p>

<h2>The Good Shepherd</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 57</div>


<div class='cap'>AT THE SIDE of the Temple buildings toward the
east stood a long balcony or archway, roofed over,
with a row of pillars on each side. It was called
"Solomon's Porch." On the eastern side it looked over
the valley of the brook Kedron, and beyond the valley
to the Mount of Olives. In the west it fronted on the
great court of the Gentiles. This porch was about a
thousand feet long.</div>

<p>At the time of the Feast of the Dedication, it was
winter, and Jesus was walking with his disciples in this
porch. The Jews gathered around him and asked:</p>

<p>"How long are you going to keep our minds in
uncertainty? If you are really the Christ, the King of
Israel foretold by the prophets of old, tell us plainly."</p>

<p>"I have already told you," answered Jesus, "and
you do not believe me. The works that I do in the name
of my Father, they speak for me; but you do not listen
because you do not belong to my flock. My sheep listen
to my voice; I know them, and they follow me; and I
give to them the life everlasting; and they shall not be
lost, and no one will ever snatch them out of my hands.
My Father who has given them to me is stronger than
all; and no one can snatch anything out of my Father's
hand."</p>

<p>Then Jesus gave the parable or story of "The Good
Shepherd." He said:</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-323.png" width="300" height="218" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Eastern sheepfold</span>
</div>

<p>"I tell you in truth, whoever does not go into the
sheepfold through the door, but climbs up somewhere else,
that man is a thief and a robber. But the man who goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
through the door is a shepherd of the sheep. The watchman
opens the door for him; and the sheep listen to his
voice. He calls his own sheep by their names, for he
knows each one of them, and leads them out. When he
has brought all his sheep outside, he walks in front of
them; and his sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
When a stranger speaks to them, they will not follow
him, but will run away from him, for they do not know
a stranger's voice."</p>

<p>Jesus spoke to them this parable, but they did not
understand its meaning.
So he explained
it to them.</p>

<p>"In truth I tell
you," he said, "I am
the Door for the sheep.
All who ever came
before me and not in
my name, were thieves
and robbers, but the
sheep would not listen
to them. I am the
Door, whoever enters by me will be safe; and he shall
go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only
to kill and to destroy. I have come that they may
have life and have it to the full.</p>


<p>"I am not only the Door, but also the Good Shepherd.
The Good Shepherd lays down his own life for his
sheep. The hired man, who is not a shepherd and does
not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, runs away
and leaves the sheep. Then the wolf tears them and
scatters the flock. The hired man does this, just because
he is only a hired man, and does not care about the
sheep.</p>

<p>"I am the Good Shepherd; I know my sheep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
my sheep know me&mdash;just as the Father knows me, and
I know the Father&mdash;and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>

<p>"I have other sheep, too, which do not belong to this
fold; these also I must lead, and they will listen to my
voice; and so it
will be one flock
and one Shepherd.</p>

<p>"On this account
my Father
loves me because
I lay down my
life, to take it up
again. No one
took it from me,
but I lay it down
of myself. I
have power to lay
it down, and I
have power to
take it up again.
This is the command
which my
Father has given
me. I and my
Father are one."</p>

<img src="images/illus-324.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The Good Shepherd</span>
</div>

<p>Suddenly, as
he spoke these
words, the Jews
began again to
pick up stones to throw at him. Jesus said to them:</p>

<p>"I have done many good works of God. For which
of these works would you now stone me?"</p>

<p>The Jews answered, "It is not for any good work
that we would stone you, but for those dreadful words,
words that would make you, a mere man, to be God!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus answered, "Is it not written in your law, 'I
said, you are gods'? If the law calls those 'gods' to whom
God spoke his word&mdash;and God's book must speak the
truth&mdash;then why is it such a terrible thing for one whom
God has set apart and sent into the world as his messenger,
to say of himself 'I am God's Son'? If I am not doing
the work of my Father, do not believe me; but if I am
doing it, even though you will not believe me, believe
what my work shows. Then you will learn and understand
that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."</p>

<p>Once again they tried to seize him, but he escaped
from their hands and went away from Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Sending Out the Seventy</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 58</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER LEAVING Jerusalem, at the time of the
Feast of the Dedication, Jesus went across the
Jordan, and followed the river upward to the place
twelve or thirteen miles below the Sea of Galilee; the
place where he had been baptized by John, and where
soon after his baptism he found his earliest followers.
This place was called by two names, "Bethabara,"
which means, "the town of the ford," that is where one
could wade across the river; and "Bethany beyond
Jordan," to keep it distinct from the other Bethany near
Jerusalem, where Martha and Mary lived.</div>

<p>The twelve disciples were with Jesus at Bethabara,
and some who came with him from Jerusalem and Judea.
Also when the news went abroad in Galilee that Jesus
was at this place, many more hastened to meet him; so
that soon a large number of his followers gathered around
him. Jesus was now near the border of the land on the
east of the Jordan, known as Perea. This word means
"beyond," and the land was so named because it was
"beyond the Jordan" from Judea.</p>

<p>Jesus had never visited this land, although he had
preached in every other part of the country; in Judea
on the south; in Galilee on the north; in Decapolis on
the northeast; and even in Samaria, where the people
were not Jews but Samaritans. He made up his mind
now to go through Perea preaching, as he had preached
in all the other parts of the land. But in Perea, his
time must be short, because now only three months
remained before the Feast of the Passover, and at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
time he must be in Jerusalem. In order to make the
people of Perea ready for his coming, and to bring together
as many as possible to hear him, he chose the places in
that land to be visited. Then he called seventy men from
among his followers, and sent them by two and two to these
cities and the villages around them, to preach to the people
and tell them that Jesus was soon to come among them.</p>

<p>To these seventy preachers, Jesus gave the same commands
that he had given to the Twelve some months before,
when he sent them out to preach in Galilee. He said:</p>

<p>"Do not take with you a purse of money, or a bag
for food, or an extra pair of sandals. Do not stop to
give greetings to any who meet you on the road. Wherever
you go into a house, first say, 'May peace be to this
house!' Then if one is there who is in the spirit of peace,
your peace will rest upon him; otherwise it will come back
to you. Stay at that same house while you are in that
city, and eat and drink whatever they offer you, for
the workman has a right to his wages. Do not move
around from one house to another. Whatever town you
visit, if the people give you welcome, eat what is given you;
cure those that are sick; and be sure to say to the people
everywhere, 'The kingdom of God is coming very soon.'</p>

<p>"But whatever town you visit, if the people will not
receive you nor listen to your message, go out into the
streets of that place and cry aloud, 'The very dust of your
city that clings to our feet we wipe off as a sign against
you; but be sure of this, that the kingdom of God is
coming to you soon.' I tell you that in God's day when
he will judge men, the punishment of Sodom will be
easier to bear than the punishment of that town!"</p>

<p>The seventy men went out from Bethabara, going
in pairs, two men together, making thirty-five pairs.
They visited all the cities and villages in the country of
Perea to which Jesus had sent them, the places which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
was expecting to visit later; gave to the people the
message of Jesus, that the kingdom of God was soon to
appear, and thus aroused the people everywhere to an
interest in the coming of Jesus. Their errand was
finished in a few weeks, for thirty-five pairs of men could
soon visit many places; and when they came again to
Bethabara, they found Jesus still there.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus-328.jpg" width="250" height="196" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">A scorpion</span>
</div>
<p>They told Jesus what places they had visited and
how they had wrought many cures in his name and
through the power which he had
given them. With great joy
they said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"Master, even the evil
spirits obey us when we use your
name!"</p>

<p>And Jesus answered them,
"Yes, I have seen Satan, the
chief of the evil spirits, fall from
heaven like a flash of lightning
from the sky. Remember, I have given you the power to
tread on serpents and scorpions, and to trample under
your feet all the power of the enemy; nothing shall
in any way do you any harm. Only, do not rejoice
merely because the evil spirits submit to you; but rejoice
more because your names are written in heaven as the
children of God."</p>



<p>While Jesus was at Bethabara, many people came to
see him and to hear his words. As this was one of the places
where John the Baptist had preached three years before,
they compared Jesus with John, and many of them said:</p>

<p>"John the Baptist never gave any wonderful works as
signs that God had sent him; but he spoke about this man;
and all that he ever said of this man was the truth."</p>

<p>And while Jesus was at Bethabara many people
believed in him and became his followers.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>




<h2>Lazarus Called Out of His Tomb</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 59</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was still at Bethabara, and expecting
soon to begin his journey through Perea,
news came to him which led him for a time to
change his plans.</div>

<p>At Bethany, near Jerusalem, as you remember,
were living his dear friends, Martha and Mary and
Lazarus. The two sisters sent to Jesus at Bethabara
the word:</p>

<p>"Lord, your friend Lazarus is very ill."</p>

<p>They did not ask Jesus to come and cure Lazarus,
but they hoped that he might come, although it would
call for a journey sixty miles from Bethabara to Bethany.
But Jesus did not at once go to the sick man. He said:</p>

<p>"This sickness is not to end in his death; the end
of it will be to give glory to God and to the Son of
God."</p>

<p>Jesus loved Martha and Mary and Lazarus. Yet,
when he heard that Lazarus was very ill, he stayed two
days longer at Bethabara. Then, after that, he said to
his disciples, "Let us go again to Judea."</p>

<p>At this the disciples were greatly surprised. They
said to him, "Why, Master, only a little while ago the
men of Judea were trying to stone you. Is it safe for
you to go there again?"</p>

<p>"Are there not twelve hours in the day?" answered
Jesus. "If a man walks about through the day, he
does not stumble, because he can have the light of the
sun; but if he walks at night, he does stumble, because
he has no light."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/illus-330.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">With a loud voice, Jesus called: &quot;Lazarus! Come out!&quot; And out from the
tomb came the man who had been dead.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he added, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen
asleep; I am going to wake him."</p>

<p>"If he has fallen asleep, Master," said the disciples,
"he will get well."</p>

<p>They thought that Jesus was speaking of taking rest
in sleep, which would show that a fever was passing
away; but Jesus meant that Lazarus was in the sleep
of death. Then he told them in plain words:</p>

<p>"Lazarus is dead; and on your account I am glad
that I was not there; for now you will learn to believe in
me more fully. Come, now, let us go to him."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-331.jpg" width="500" height="261" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Bethany, where Martha, Mary and Lazarus lived.</span>
</div>

<p>At this, Thomas, one of his twelve disciples, who
was also called "Didymus," a word meaning "The Twin,"
said to his fellow disciples:</p>

<p>"Let us go too; and if he dies, we will die with him."</p>

<p>So from Bethabara they went again to Bethany, two
miles from Jerusalem; a journey of about sixty miles.
When Jesus came to Bethany, he found that Lazarus
had been already four days in the tomb. In the house
with Martha and Mary were a number of their
friends who had come to show their sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the sisters by weeping with them over their brother's
death.</p>

<p>Someone went into the room and told Martha that
Jesus was coming, and was near the village. She rose
up quietly and hastened to meet Jesus, while Mary sat
still in the room. When Martha saw Jesus, she said to
him mournfully:</p>

<p>"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not
have died. And even now, I know that whatever you
ask of God, he will give it to you."</p>

<p>"Your brother shall rise to life again," said Jesus.</p>

<p>"I know that he will rise again," said Martha,
"when all the dead shall be raised up, at the last day."</p>

<p>"I, myself," said Jesus, "am the one who raises the
dead to life. He who believes in me shall live again, even
if he dies; and he who lives believing in me shall never
die. Do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," she said, "I do believe that you are
the Christ, the Son of God, who was promised to come
into the world."</p>

<p>After saying this, Martha went again to the house,
leaving Jesus still outside the village. She whispered
to her sister Mary:</p>

<p>"The Master is here, and he has asked for you."</p>

<p>On hearing this, Mary rose in haste and went to the
place where Jesus was. The friends who were with her,
seeing her go out of the house, thought that she was going
to the tomb, to weep there, and they followed her, to
weep with her. It was the custom in that land, and still
is the custom, for those who had lost a friend, to meet
at his grave, day after day, and there to mourn for him.</p>

<p>But Mary did not go to her brother's tomb. She
went to Jesus, who was still at the place where Martha
had met him; and threw herself at his feet, saying, as
her sister had said before:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Master! if only you had been here, my brother
would not have died!"</p>

<p>When Jesus saw her wailing, and saw the friends with
her wailing, he too was troubled and greatly distressed.</p>

<p>"Where have you laid him," he asked.</p>

<p>"Come and see, Master," they answered.</p>

<p>Jesus now began to weep, in feeling for the two
sisters.</p>

<p>"How he must have loved him!" said the Jews to
each other. But some of them said:</p>

<p>"Could not this man, who gave sight to a blind
man, have kept this man from dying?"</p>

<p>Again groaning, but quietly, Jesus came to the
tomb. Like many of the graves in that land, it was a
cave in the rocky hillside, and a large stone covered its
mouth.</p>

<p>"Move away the stone," commanded Jesus.</p>

<p>"Master," said Martha, "remember that he has
been dead four days, and by this time there may be a
strong smell from the body."</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you," said Jesus, "that if you will
only believe in me you will see the glory of God?"</p>

<p>They moved the stone away from the door of the
cave, and Jesus, lifting his eyes upward, said:</p>

<p>"Father, I thank thee for listening to my prayer.
I knew that thou always hearest me; but I spoke on
account of those around me, that they might believe
that thou hast sent me."</p>

<p>Then with a loud voice, Jesus called:</p>

<p>"Lazarus! Come out!"</p>

<p>Out from the tomb came the man who had been
dead. He could scarcely walk, for his hands and feet
were wrapped with bandages; his face, too, had been
covered with a cloth tied over it.</p>

<p>"Set him free," said Jesus, "and let him go!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>They took away the cloth from his face, and
unwrapped the bandages from his body; and Lazarus
stood up living and well, in the presence of all the people!
How happy were Martha and Mary, as they placed their
arms around him, and felt his flesh, warm with the life-blood
once more flowing through his veins!</p>

<p>As the Jews who had come to visit Martha and Mary
saw this wonderful work, calling back to life a man who
had been in his tomb four days, many of them believed
in Jesus. These told the story to others, and the number
of believers grew larger and larger.</p>

<p>Some of those who had seen or had heard of the
raising of Lazarus to life went to Jerusalem and told the
Pharisees, the enemies of Jesus, what had taken place.
These men told the chief priests, and the priests and
Pharisees called together the high council to talk
of these things and to decide what should be done
with Jesus.</p>

<p>This high council was a board or company of leading
men, which, next to the Roman governor, ruled over the
Jews. It was made up of seventy-two men, some of them
priests and some of them scribes or teachers of the law.
They met in a room set apart for their use in the Temple;
and they formed the highest court in the land to deal
with any who were accused of having broken the laws.</p>

<p>When this council came together and heard of what
Jesus had done and of the people who, in greater number
than ever, were beginning to believe in Jesus, they said
to each other, "What shall we do, now that this Jesus
has done another work, more wonderful even than any
of his works in the past? If we leave him alone, all the
people will believe in him, and will seek to make him
their King. Then the Romans will come, and will
destroy our Temple, and will no longer let us live as a
nation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>But one of these men in the council was the high
priest, whose name was Caiaphas. He said to them:</p>

<p>"You are entirely mistaken. You do not understand
that whether Jesus is or is not a prophet coming
from God, it is better that one man should die, instead
of having all the people destroyed. Let us all agree that
Jesus shall be killed, and that the people of Israel shall
be saved from death."</p>

<p>These words of Caiaphas the high priest meant more
than he knew when he spoke them. He was himself,
being the high priest, speaking a prophecy, that Jesus
was to die for the people; for that was what Jesus was
soon to do. He was to die for the sins of the people; not
only for the Jewish people but for all the people of the
world. By his death, Jesus was to bring together into
one body all the children of God scattered throughout
all the lands.</p>

<p>At that meeting of the council, the rulers decided
that Jesus must be killed. Not all of them agreed in
this, for Nicodemus, who long before had come at night
to talk with Jesus, and a rich member of the council,
named Joseph&mdash;of whom we shall hear later&mdash;and a few
others, were friendly to Jesus. But his enemies were so
many and so fierce that these few friends of Jesus did not
venture to speak for him. So the vote was taken that
Jesus was to be put to death.</p>

<p>Jesus, knowing all things, knew their plans; and
he knew that when the time came he should die. But
that time had not yet come, for he had promised to
preach his gospel in Perea, across the Jordan. He went,
therefore, to a town on the edge of the wilderness, called
Ephraim, and there for a few weeks he stayed with his
disciples.</p>

<p>The great Feast of the Passover was drawing near,
and many people were coming up to Jerusalem to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
themselves for the Feast. They were looking out for
Jesus, and said to each other as they walked in the courts
of the Temple:</p>

<p>"What do you think? Do you think that Jesus will
come to the Feast?"</p>

<p>The chief priests and the leading Pharisees had
given orders that if any one found out where Jesus was,
they were to be told, so that they might send men to
arrest him.</p>

<h2>Jesus Preaching in Perea</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 60</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS DID not stay long in the village of Ephraim.
He went down the mountains to the river Jordan,
crossed it, and began preaching in the land of Perea,
going to the places where his seventy messengers had
given the news of his coming.</div>

<p>Everywhere the people thronged in great crowds
to see him and to hear him. The rich and the poor met
in the crowd, the rulers and the common people, the
Pharisees who were his enemies, and the publicans or
tax-collectors who had been leading lives full of sin.
There was a great desire among the people to listen to the
Teacher and Prophet from Galilee, of whom they had
heard so much, and whom they had not seen before.
Many went to see him because they believed that he
was the long-looked-for Christ, who was at last on his
way to Jerusalem to sit on his throne and rule all the
lands. So great were the crowds to see and hear Jesus
that it is said that the thousands trod on each other
around him.</p>

<p>While he was speaking in one place to a great multitude
of people, a voice was heard from the throng.</p>

<p>"Teacher," cried out a man, "tell my brother to
divide with me the property which belongs to our family."</p>

<p>This man supposed that Jesus, being the King of
Israel, would rule in all matters of difference between the
people. But Jesus answered him:</p>

<p>"Man, who made me a judge or a settler of disputes
over your affairs?"</p>

<p>Then he added, "Take care to avoid the love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
money; for no matter how rich one may be, his true life
does not depend on what he owns."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-338.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Home of a rich man in Palestine</span>
</div>

<p>And he gave to them the parable or story of "The
Poor Rich Man." He said:</p>

<p>"There was once a rich man whose farm gave him
very large crops. He began to ask himself, 'What am I
to do? I have no room to store the grain and fruits
that have grown on my land. This is what I will do.
I will pull down my old barns and build larger ones in
place of them. There I shall store all the fruits from
my orchards and the grain from my fields. And then
I will say to myself, "Now you have plenty of good
things stored up to last for many years; take your ease,
eat, drink and have a good time."' But God said to him
'Fool! this very night your life is taken away; and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
will have all that you have stored up?' So is it with
everyone who lays up money for himself, instead of gaining
the riches of God."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-339.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Look at the lilies, and see how they grow&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And Jesus said again to his disciples some of the
things that he had already taught them in his great
"Sermon on the Mount"; for he often repeated the
same teachings, over and over, until the disciples knew
them by heart, so that after he should be taken from
them, they in turn could tell them to others. At this
time he said:</p>

<p>"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your
life here on the earth, what you can get to eat, nor what
you can get to wear. Life is something more than food
and the body is more than its clothes. Look at the
crows flying through the air! They neither sow nor
reap; they have no storehouse nor barns; and yet God
gives them food. How much more are you worth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
God than are the birds? And however anxious you may
be, can you add one minute to your life? And if you
cannot do even this, why be anxious about other
matters?</p>

<p>"Look at the lilies, and see how they grow. They
neither spin nor weave; and yet, I tell you, even King
Solomon in all his splendor was not dressed like one of
these. Now, if God so beautifully clothes the grass in
the field, which blooms today, and tomorrow will be
thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you,
O men, who trust God so little?</p>

<p>"So do not worry about food and drink and clothes;
these are the things for which the nations of the world
who know not God are seeking after, and you should not
wish to be like them. Besides, your Father in heaven
knows that you have need of these common things.
Only seek the kingdom of God, and your heavenly Father
will see to it that you have these things. Do not be
afraid, my little flock, for your Father has been pleased
to give you a place in his kingdom."</p>

<p>At this time some people brought to Jesus the news
that Pilate, the Roman governor, had killed in the
Temple some men from Galilee, while they were worshipping
at the altar, so that their blood was poured out
with the blood of their offerings. This act of the governor
had terribly shocked the people.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," said Jesus, "that because those
Galileans suffered these things, that they were worse
sinners than the rest of those living in Galilee? I tell
you, no; unless you turn from your sins and seek God,
you will all perish as they did.</p>

<p>"Then, too, think of those eighteen men in Siloam,
just outside of Jerusalem; those men on whom the tower
fell and killed them all; do you suppose that they had
been worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
No, I tell you; unless you turn to God, you will all perish
as they did."</p>

<p>Then Jesus gave to the people the parable of "The
Fruitless Fig Tree." He said:</p>

<p>"A man who had a fig tree growing in his garden
came at the time when figs were ripe, looking for fruit,
but found on it not a single fig. So he said to the
gardener, 'Here I have come for three years looking for
fruit on this tree, without finding any. Cut it down!
Why should it take up room and rob the soil?' But the
gardener answered him, 'O please, sir, leave it one year
more. I will dig around it and enrich the soil; then it
may bear fruit next year. If it does not, then let it be
cut down.'"</p>

<h2>In the Church and at the Feast</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 61</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was in Perea, on the Sabbath days
he went into the churches and spoke there;
and in every place the church was crowded with
those who were eager to hear him. On one Sabbath day
he saw in the church a woman who for eighteen years
had been bent double and could not possibly stand up
straight. When Jesus saw her, he called her to him.</div>

<p>"Woman," he said, "you are set free from your
weakness."</p>

<p>He placed his hands upon her, and instantly power
came to her. She stood up erect, and with a loud voice
praised God for her cure. But the president of the
board in the church was greatly displeased that Jesus
had done this on the Sabbath. He said to the people:</p>

<p>"There are six days in the week for work; come on
one of these to be cured, and not on the holy Sabbath."</p>

<p>"O you false-hearted men, making a pretense of
serving God!" said the Lord Jesus. "Does not each one
of you on the Sabbath day unloose his ox or his ass from
its manger, and lead it out to drink? And this woman,
a daughter of Abraham our father, whom the evil one
has held bound for all these eighteen years, should she
not be set free on the Sabbath?"</p>

<p>As he said this all those who were opposed to him
felt ashamed of themselves; while the people rejoiced
to see all his wonderful doings. As Jesus went through
the towns and villages, all the time on his way toward
Jerusalem, he repeated many of the parables and teachings
that he had given in other parts of the land, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
"The Narrow Door," "The Mustard Seed," "The
Yeast in the Dough," and others.</p>

<p>The land of Perea, where he was now teaching,
belonged to the Kingdom of Herod. Some Pharisees,
who were enemies of Jesus, came to him and said:</p>

<p>"You had better get away from this land, for King
Herod means to kill you."</p>

<p>This they said, not to save the life of Jesus, but to
make him leave their land. But Jesus answered them:</p>

<p>"You may go and tell that fox that I am casting out
the evil spirits and curing diseases today and tomorrow,
and on the third day I shall finish my work. But I
must go on my way today, tomorrow and the day after
tomorrow, for it would never do for a prophet to meet
his end except in Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!
killing the prophets and stoning those whom God has
sent to you! How often would I have gathered your
children around me, as a fowl gathers her brood under
her wings! But you would not come! Truly, your
house is left to you to be destroyed. Never, I tell you,
shall you see me again until the day comes when you will
say, 'Blessed be He who comes in the name of the
Lord.'"</p>

<p>In one place he was invited by one of the rulers who
was a Pharisee to come to his house for dinner. There
were at the table other Pharisees and people not friendly
to Jesus, and they watched him closely. He saw in the
room a man who was swollen with the dropsy; and
Jesus asked the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:</p>

<p>"Is it according to the law to cure a sick man on
the Sabbath, or is it not?"</p>

<p>They said nothing. Then Jesus laid his hands on
the man and cured him, and sent him away. Afterward
he said:</p>

<p>"Is there any one of you who, finding on the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
day that his ass or his ox has fallen into a pit, will
not at once pull him out without waiting for a working
day?"</p>

<p>They could not answer him this question. He
noticed that those who had been invited to the dinner
picked out for themselves the best places, near the head
of the table; and he gave them this advice.</p>

<p>"When you are invited to a marriage feast, do not
take one of the best places. It may be that some person
of higher rank than you has been invited; and then the
one who gives the feast comes to you and says, 'Here,
make room for this man!' Then you must get up
ashamed and take a place down at the foot of the table.
No, when you come to the feast, go to the lowest place,
then when the giver of the feast sees you, he will say,
'My friend, come up higher,' and you will be honored
in the presence of all your fellow-guests. For every one
who lifts up himself shall be humbled; and the one who
humbles himself shall be lifted up."</p>

<p>Jesus said also to the ruler who had invited him,
"When you give a dinner or a supper, do not ask your
friends, or your brothers, or those who are your relatives,
or your rich neighbors, for they may invite you in turn,
and thus you will be repaid. No, when you give a
dinner, invite the poor, the cripples, those who have lost
an arm, and the blind. Then God will give you his
blessing; for these people cannot repay you; and you
will receive your reward when God raises up the good
from their graves to everlasting life."</p>

<p>One of those at the table heard these words of
Jesus; and he spoke out, "Happy will he be who shall
sit down at that feast in the kingdom of God!"</p>

<p>Jesus answered him by giving the parable of "The
Supper and the Excuses." He said:</p>

<p>"There was once a man who was giving a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
supper, to which he had invited many of his friends.
At the hour for the supper, he sent out his servant to
say to the guests who had been invited, 'Come at once,
for everything is now ready!' But all of them with one
mind began to decline his invitation. The first man
said to the servant:</p>

<p>"'I have bought some land, and I must go and
look at it. Please to excuse me.'</p>

<p>"The second said, 'I have bought five pair of oxen,
and I am going to give them a trial. Please to have me
excused.'</p>

<p>"Another said, 'I cannot come, because I have just
married a wife.'</p>

<p>"The servant went home and told his master all
these answers. Then the master of the house was very
angry. He said to his servant:</p>

<p>"'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the
town, and bring in here the poor, the cripples, the blind
and the lame.'</p>

<p>"Soon the servant came back, saying, 'Your orders
have been carried out, sir; but there is still room for
more.'</p>

<p>"'Go out into the country,' said the master of the
house, 'to the roads and the hedges, and make the people
come in, to fill up my house; for I tell you that not one
of those that were invited shall taste of my supper.'"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>




<h2>On Counting the Cost</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 62</div>


<div class='cap'>AT THIS TIME while Jesus was in Perea, preaching
in the towns, greater crowds than ever before were
following him, claiming to believe in him as the
son of David and the King of Israel. Most of these
people saw that he was going toward Jerusalem, and the
report went abroad among them that when he reached
that city he would take the throne that had been King
David's; and not only would be king of that land but
lead the Jewish people to conquer all the lands. Very
many of the crowd following Jesus had no thought of
what it meant to be his disciples. They were expecting
great things&mdash;riches and honor and power&mdash;but knew
nothing of the sufferings that Jesus must endure and that
his followers must face in the days soon to come.</div>

<p>Jesus was not willing to have such careless and
thoughtless followers as these. He spoke to them words
that seemed harsh and forbidding, but were meant to
make them think of what they must meet if they would
be among those who believed in him. Turning to the
multitudes that were flocking around him, he called
out to them:</p>

<p>"If anyone comes to me, and does not hate his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers
and sisters, yes, and his own life besides, he cannot be
a disciple of mine. Whoever does not carry his own
cross and walk in my steps cannot be a disciple of mine!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<a href="images/illus-348-big.png"><img src="images/illus-348.png" width="320" height="400" alt="map" /></a>
</div>

<p>Jesus did not mean quite all these words he seemed
to speak. He did not wish sons and daughters really to
hate their fathers and mothers, nor parents to hate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
own children; but he did mean that no one should say,
'My father and mother do not consent to my following
Jesus, and therefore I cannot be his disciple.' Nor did
he wish that parents should say, 'I have children to care
for, and I must not believe in Jesus, and become his
disciple.' He wished those who were following him without
thought, to ask themselves whether they were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to lose all for Christ's sake, and to serve him, no matter
who were opposed to him or what they might suffer in
his service.</p>

<p>"Who of you," said Jesus, "when he wants to build
a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, and
see whether he has enough money to finish it? If he
can only lay the foundation, and then must leave the
work unfinished, everybody who sees the half-completed
wall will laugh at him and say, 'This fellow began to
build, but he could not finish!'</p>

<p>"Or what king sets out to go to war with another
king, and does not first sit down to consider whether
with ten thousand soldiers he can fight the king who
comes against him with twenty thousand? If he does
not dare to meet his enemy, then while his army is still
a great way off, he sends an officer to ask for terms of
peace. So will it be with every one of you who will not
give up all that he has; he cannot be a disciple of mine."</p>

<p>What Jesus meant was this, "Think whether you
will hold out to the end, if you would be among my
followers. And think, too, whether you will dare to
meet the hate and opposition that you must overcome
in becoming my disciples." He went on with such words
as these:</p>

<p>"Every true disciple of mine is like salt; and salt is
good as long as it has its own salty taste. But if it
loses its saltiness and becomes tasteless, is there any way
to make it good salt again? It is of no use either for the
land, nor even for the manure heap, but people throw
it away as useless. So will it be with everyone who loses
the salt of my life in himself. Now, do not let these
words of mine go into one ear and out from the other.

</div>


<div class='cap'>THE PHARISEES were very careful to keep all the
rules of the Jewish law, and were supposed to
be very religious, because they prayed often
in public places
and went regularly
to church.
But Jesus saw
that their religion
was only pretended
and not real,
and would have
nothing to do
with them, except
rebuke them for
their sins. The
scribes, who were
the teachers of
the law in the
churches, expected
Jesus to give
them special honor.
But both
Pharisees and
scribes were very
angry when they
found that Jesus
paid them no attention,
and was
friendly with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
tax-collectors whom all the Jews despised and hated.
Jesus even allowed some to come near him who were
outcasts, people who did not go to church and did not try
to keep the rules of the Jews.</div>

<p>The Pharisees and the scribes said in great scorn of
Jesus, "This man
welcomes sinners,
and even sits
down at the table
to eat with
them!"</p>

<span class="caption">Searching for the lost silver-piece</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus heard
of their words,
and answered
them in the parable
of "The Lost
Sheep." He said:</p>

<p>"If one of
you has a hundred
sheep, and
loses one of them,
does he not leave
the ninety and
nine sheep in the
sheepfold out in
the fields, and go
after the lost one
until he finds it.
When he has
found it, he puts
it on his shoulders
with great joy and carries it home. And when he comes
to his house, he calls together his neighbors and his
friends, saying to them, 'Come and be glad with me; for
I have found my sheep which was lost.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I tell you, there is more joy in heaven over one
outcast sinner who turns away from his sin to God, than
over ninety-nine religious men who are good already and
do not need to turn from sin."</p>

<p>A lady has written this parable in verses that have
been set to music and sung many times. These are
her verses:</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Ninety and Nine</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
There were ninety and nine that safely lay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shelter of the fold,</span><br />
But one was out on the hills away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far off from the gates of gold&mdash;</span><br />
Away on the mountains wild and bare,<br />
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.<br />
<br />
"Lord, thou hast here thy ninety and nine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are they not enough for thee?"</span><br />
But the Shepherd made answer, "'Tis of mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has wandered away from me;</span><br />
And although the road be rough and steep<br />
I go to the desert to find my sheep."<br />
<br />
But none of the ransomed ever knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How deep were the waters crossed;</span><br />
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere he found his sheep that was lost.</span><br />
Out in the desert he heard its cry,<br />
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.<br />
<br />
"Lord, whence are those blood drops all the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That mark out the mountain's track?"</span><br />
"They were shed for one who had gone astray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."</span><br />
"Lord, whence are thy hands so rent and torn?"<br />
"They are pierced tonight by many a thorn."<br />
<br />
But all through the mountains, thunder-riven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up from the rocky steep,</span><br />
There arose a cry to the gate of heaven:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Rejoice! I have found my sheep!"</span><br />
And the angels echoed around the throne,<br />
"Rejoice! for the Lord brings back his own!"<br />

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus also gave to the people another parable,
"The Lost Silver-piece." He said:</p>

<p>"Or, if there is a woman who has ten silver coins,
and loses one of them, what will she do? She will light
her lamp, and sweep her house, and search carefully for
her money, until she finds it. And when she finds it,
she goes out and calls together her women-friends and
neighbors, and says, 'Come and rejoice with me, for I
have found the silver-piece which I had lost.'</p>

<p>"Even so, I tell you there is rejoicing among the
angels of God over one sinner that turns to God."</p>

<p>It might be asked&mdash;why did the woman need to
light a lamp when searching for her lost coin? In that
land, the houses of the plain people have either no
windows, or one window for the whole house, which is
merely a hole in the wall. The rooms are dark, even at
mid-day, and to look on the floor thoroughly, and especially
in the corners, a lamp must be lighted and carried
close to the floor.</p>

<h2>The Parable of the Lost Son Found</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 64</div>


<div class='cap'>YOU REMEMBER that the enemies of Jesus, the
Pharisees and scribes, said of him, "He gives welcome
to bad men, and eats at the table with them!"
Jesus in answer gave a parable or story to show how God
welcomes a sinner who turns from his sin and seeks his
heavenly Father. This is one of the most beautiful
among all the parables of Jesus. It is called "The
Prodigal Son." The word "prodigal" means one who
spends his money, throwing it away in a careless manner;
and this story is of a young man who spent all the
money that his father gave him. Here is the parable:</div>

<p>"There was once a man," said Jesus, "who had
two sons. The older son stayed at home and helped his
father in the care of his farm, but the younger son was
restless and wanted to go away. The young man said
to his father:</p>

<p>"'Father, give me now the share of what you own
which will come to me after you die.'</p>

<p>"So the father divided all that he had, his land, his
vineyards, his olive orchards, his fig trees, his houses,
his flocks of sheep and goats, and his money, into three
equal parts. Two of these parts he kept for the older
son; and the third part he gave to the younger son;
for in that land it was the rule for the older son, as the
head of the family, to receive twice as much as a younger
son.</p>

<p>"After a few days, the young man sold out his share
of the property for ready money, and then went away to
a land far off, where he could live as he pleased. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
he began to lead a foolish and wild life, feasting and
drinking wine with worthless men and women. It did
not take him many months to spend all his money and
to be in great want. None of these people who had
helped him in his pleasures were now ready to help him
in his need. And what added to his trouble was that
just then food became very scarce in that country and
there was not bread enough for all the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-355.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;There in the open field among the grunting hogs sat this young man&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"This young man was in want of everything. His
clothes became rags, his shoes were worn out, and what
was worse, he could get nothing to eat and was starving
for the want of food. Never before had he done any
work, but now, driven by hunger he went everywhere
looking for something to do which would give him a
mouthful of bread. At last he found a man who was
willing to hire him. This man sent him out into his
field to take care of his pigs and feed them. This was
a work felt to be disgraceful, for no Jew would eat pig's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
meat or in any way touch the vile animals. But even
this work the poor young man was compelled to do
rather than starve to death. In the field he was so
hungry that he
was ready to
snatch up some
of the bean-pods
on which the pigs
were feeding; and
no one in that
country cared for
him or would
even give him
something to eat.</p>

<div><img src="images/illus-356a.jpg" alt="painting top" width="336" height="413" class="split" /></div>
<div><img src="images/illus-356b.jpg" alt="painting bottom" width="500" height="157" class="split" /></div>

<p>"So there in
the open field
among the grunting
hogs sat this
young man, ragged,
famished
and almost ready
to die. Suddenly
the thought came to him of his father's house, where
once he had enjoyed plenty and lived at ease, waited
upon by servants. He now saw how foolish, how
ungrateful to a kind father, and how wicked he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
been. It seemed to him as if he had been living in a
dream, had now for the first time awaked and had come
to his senses. He said to himself:</p>

<p>"'Why, even the hired men on my father's farm
have more food than they can eat; and here I am almost
dead with hunger! I will get up and will go to my
father; and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned
against God in heaven and against you. I don't deserve
any more to be called your son; only make me one of
your servants working for wages."'</p>

<p>"So the poor young man left the field and the pigs,
and went back to his father's house. There in the door
sat his father waiting and watching for his wandering
son. While the son was still a long distance away, the
father saw him and knew him, barefoot and ragged as
he was. He felt pity for his son, whose looks showed
his utter misery, and ran to him, fell upon his neck,
placed his arms around him and kissed him.</p>

<p>"'Father,' said the young man, 'I have sinned
against God in heaven and against you. I don't deserve
any more to be called your son&mdash;' But the father did not
wait to hear him any further. He called out to the
servants:</p>

<p>"'Be quick, bring some new clothes, the very best
in the house, and put them on him; bring a ring to place
around his wrist and sandals for his feet; go pick out
the fattest calf in the stall, and kill it for a feast! Let
us all eat and have a happy time together. For this son
of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was
lost and is found!'</p>

<p>"So they began to make merry. Now the older
son was out in the field; and as he came near the house,
he heard the sounds of music and dancing. Wondering
what was the cause of such gladness, he called to him
one of the servants and asked what all this meant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Your brother has come home,' answered the
servant, 'and your father has killed the fattest of the
calves, and is having a feast, because he has him back
safe and sound.'</p>

<p>"This made the older son very angry. He would
not go in to the supper, but stayed outside. His father
came out and begged him to come in and give a welcome
to his brother.</p>

<p>"But he refused, saying, 'Think of all the years
that I have been serving you! Never have I once disobeyed
you; and yet you have never given me even a
little kid out of the flock of goats, for me to have a
merrymaking with my friends. But as soon as this son
of yours comes home, who has wasted your money with
vile people, you kill the fatted calf and for him make
a great feast.'</p>

<p>"'My son,' said the father, 'you and I are always
together, and everything that I have is yours. We
could not help being glad and rejoicing; for your brother
here was dead, and is alive again; he was lost and is
found.'"</p>

<p>You can see that in this elder brother of the story
was the spirit of the Pharisees and the scribes, who were
displeased because Jesus was willing to welcome those
who had been sinful, when they came to him, sorry for
their sins.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Parable of the Dishonest Steward</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 65</div>


<div class='cap'>AT THIS TIME Jesus gave to his disciples the parable
of "The Dishonest Steward." A steward is
a man who takes care of any business or lands or
houses belonging to another man who employs him.
Jesus said:</div>

<p>"There was a rich man who had a steward who took
charge of all his business. Some one told the rich man
that his steward was cheating him and making a wrong
use of his money. So the master sent for the steward
and said:</p>

<p>"'What is this that I hear about you? Hand in
your accounts, for you shall not be my steward any longer.'</p>

<p>"The steward was at first greatly troubled at this;
and he did not know how he could live if his office as
steward was taken away.</p>

<p>"'What shall I do,' he said to himself, 'now that my
master is taking away from me my place as steward?
I am not strong enough to dig in the ground as a farmer,
and I am ashamed to beg in the streets. Oh, I know
what I can do, so that when my office as steward is taken
away the people will invite me to their homes to live
with them.'</p>

<p>"One by one the steward called to him the men that
were owing his master.</p>

<p>"'How much do you owe my master?' he asked of
the first.</p>

<p>"'A hundred barrels of oil,' answered the man.</p>

<p>"'Here, take your bill,' said the steward, 'and
instead of a hundred barrels, make it fifty barrels.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>This, you see, was making a present to the man of
fifty barrels of oil, but not from the steward himself;
instead, stealing it from his master, to give to the man
who owed him.</p>

<p>"Then to the next man he said, 'And how much do
you owe?'</p>

<p>"'A hundred
bushels of wheat,'
answered the
man.</p>

<p>"'Here is
your bill,' said
the steward;
'make it eighty.'</p>

<p>"And so he
treated all those
who were owing
to his master,
giving to each
one a part of
his debt; so that
they would be
friendly to him
and give him
help when he
should need it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/illus-360.jpg" width="366" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The dishonest steward</span>
</div>

<p>"When his
master heard of
all this, he
praised the steward, not for doing rightly, but for looking
ahead and taking care for the time to come."</p>

<p>And Jesus said, "The people of this world often
are wiser in looking ahead, and planning for the days to
come, than are those who have the light of God. And
I say to you: use the money of this world to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
friends with it, not on earth, but in heaven; so that
when you leave the earth, they may welcome you to
homes in heaven that never pass away. He who is
faithful with a small trust is also faithful with a large
trust; and he who is not honest but tries to cheat in
little things, will be dishonest and try to cheat in great
things. So if you cannot be trusted with the money of
this world, who will trust you with the riches of God?
And if you are not faithful with what belongs to another,
how can you expect to have anything forever as your
own?</p>

<p>"No servant can serve two masters at the same
time; for either he will hate one master and love the
other; or else he will stand by one master and despise
the other. You cannot serve God and at the same time
live for money."</p>

<p>All these things were spoken in the hearing of the
Pharisees, who were fond of money and grasping. They
listened, with contempt and scorn in their hearts.</p>

<p>Jesus knew what was in their minds, and he said to
these Pharisees:</p>

<p>"You are the men who make people believe that
you are good, but God sees and knows what is in your
hearts. What is lofty in the sight of men is vile in the
sight of God."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>




<h2>A Parable for the Lovers of Money</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 66</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS KNEW that the Pharisees, for all their church-going
and their carefulness in keeping the rules of
their law, were in their hearts lovers of money, and
were living for the things of this world and not for God.
He gave to them a parable about a rich man who suddenly
became poor, and a poor man who became rich.
It is called "The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus."</div>

<p>"There was a rich man," said Jesus, "who dressed
in purple robes, like a king, and lived in a splendid great
house, with many servants to wait upon him, and feasted
every day upon the finest food. Outside the door of
the rich man's house was laid every morning a poor
beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores and
was glad to eat the crumbs and broken pieces from the
rich man's table. The dogs of the street used to come
and lick his sores.</p>

<p>"After a time, the poor man died, and his soul was
taken by the angels to be in heaven with Abraham, the
father of God's people; because in all his poverty he
had lived for God, trying always to do God's will. The
rich man died, too, and was buried. But no angels
came to carry him to the land where Abraham was
living in happiness. His soul went to the place of woe
and sorrow and suffering; not because he had been rich,
but because in his riches he had never thought of God.</p>

<p>"The rich man, being in torment, looked up, and
far away saw Abraham, with Lazarus in his arms.</p>

<p>"'O Father Abraham,' he called out, 'take pity on
me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
water and cool my tongue, for I am burning in this
flame!'</p>

<p>"'My son,' answered Abraham, 'remember that
when you were alive on the earth you had all your
enjoyment, while Lazarus in his life had poverty and
pain. Now Lazarus has comfort for all his trouble and
you are in misery. Besides all that, between us in
heaven and you in the dwelling place of the wicked,
there is a great valley, a gulf which no one can cross,
either to go from us to you or to come from you to us.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-363.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Lazarus before the rich man&#39;s door</span>
</div>

<p>"'If that be so,' said the once-rich man, now so
poor, 'and Lazarus cannot come to me, I beg of you,
Father Abraham, to send Lazarus to my father's house;
for I have five brothers; let him speak to them in time,
so that they may not come to this place of terrible
suffering.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"'They have the writings of Moses and the words
of all the prophets,' said Abraham; 'let them listen to
these.'</p>

<p>"'But, Father Abraham,' he said, 'if some one from
the dead should go to them, they would turn from
sin to God.'</p>

<p>"'If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets,'
said Abraham, 'they will not believe, even if some one
should rise from the dead.'"</p>

<p>As the twelve disciples of Jesus heard this parable,
they said, "Lord, make our faith stronger!"</p>

<p>"If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed,"
said Jesus, "you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be
uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.</p>

<p>"Which one of you, if he had a servant plowing in
the field or tending sheep, when he comes in from the
field will say to him, 'Come at once and take your place
at the table for your supper'? No, he will say to his
servant, 'Get my supper ready; then make yourself
ready to wait on me while I am eating and drinking;
and after that you may have your supper.'</p>

<p>"Does a master thank his servant for doing what he
has been told? Well, it is the same with you; when
you have done all that you have been told, say, 'We are
only servants; we have done no more than we ought to
have done.'"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>




<h2>Two Parables Upon Prayer</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 67</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS TOLD his disciples a parable to show that
they should always keep on praying and never be
discouraged. This parable is named "The Parable
of the Unjust Judge."</div>

<p>"In a certain city," he said, "there was a judge
who in his rule did not try to do right, but was often
unjust and wicked; for he had no fear of God and no
care for what men said about him. And in that city
there was a widow who came many times to this judge,
crying over and over again, 'Do for me what is right
against the man who has done me wrong!'</p>

<p>"For some time the judge paid no attention to her,
for right and wrong were both the same to him. But
after a while the judge said to himself:</p>

<p>"'Although I have no fear of God and no care for
man, yet as this widow is so troublesome to me, and
gives me no rest, I will do what she asks, for I am tired
of her coming and of her calling out for her right
every day.'</p>

<p>"Listen," said the Lord Jesus, "to what this unjust
judge says. And if a man who does not care for right
or wrong will at last answer a prayer, how much more
will your heavenly Father listen to his own children
when they call upon him day and night, even though he
seems to make them wait long for the answer to their
prayers? I tell you that God will do right by them and
answer their prayers, and that very soon! Yet when
the Son of Man comes, will he find on earth those who
are looking for him and who believe in him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus also told a parable to some people who were
sure of their own goodness and looked down upon others.
This parable is that of "The Pharisee and the Tax-Gatherer."</p>

<p>"Two men," said Jesus, "went up to the Temple to
pray. One of these men was a Pharisee; and the other
was a tax-gatherer.
The Pharisee
stood up and
began praying to
himself, not to
God, in words
like these:</p>

<p>"'O God, I
thank thee that I
am not like other
men&mdash;thieves,
wrongdoers, and
wicked&mdash;or even
like this tax-gatherer.
Twice
in every week I
eat no food, to
show that I am
worshipping God;
I give to God's
house one-tenth of
all that I get.'</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Two men went up to the Temple to pray; one was
a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"But the tax-gatherer stood far away, and would not
raise his eyes toward heaven. He beat his breast, saying:</p>

<p>"'O God, have mercy on me and forgive my sins!'</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Jesus, "this tax-gatherer went to
his house with his sins forgiven, instead of the Pharisee.
For every one who uplifts himself will be brought low;
and every one who humbles himself will be lifted up."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Little Children; and the Rich
Young Man</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Chapter 68</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was still passing through the land
of Perea, on his way to Jerusalem, at one place
the fathers and mothers brought their babies to
him, asking him to place his hands on their heads and
speak upon them a blessing. When the disciples saw
them doing this, they were not pleased.</div>

<p>"Take these babies away!" they said. "The Lord
is too busy with greater things to attend to them!"</p>

<p>But Jesus heard them, and he was displeased, not
with the parents and their children, but with his disciples.</p>

<p>"Let the little ones come to me," he said, "and do
not stop them; for the kingdom of God comes only to
those who are child-like. I tell you, whoever will not
give himself up to the kingdom of God as a little child
shall never come into the kingdom."</p>

<p>Then he took the little ones up into his arms, laid
his hands upon them and gave them his blessing. After
that he went away from that place.</p>

<p>Soon afterward a young man who was one of the
leaders in the church of his town came running, and
bowed low before Jesus. "Good Teacher," said the
young man, "tell me what to do if I am to be saved and
have life everlasting."</p>

<p>"Why do you call me 'good'?" answered Jesus.
"There is only one who is really good; that is God.
To be saved, you have only to do God's will. You
know what his commandments are; keep them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what commands do you mean?" asked the
young man. He supposed that Jesus, like many of the
scribes, who were the teachers of God's law, had given
some special rules of his own.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "I mean the ten commandments
of God, such as, 'Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not
kill; thou shalt not say what is false; honor thy father
and thy mother,' and so on."</p>

<span class="caption">Jesus laid his hands upon the little ones and gave them his blessing</span>
</div>

<p>The young man said, "Teacher, all these I have
kept ever since I was a child. What more do I need?"</p>

<p>As Jesus looked at this young man, so eager in his
wish to please God, he loved him, and felt a special
longing to have him among his disciples.</p>

<p>"If you really wish to be perfect," he said to the
young man, "you do need one thing more. Sell everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
that you have, and give all the money to the poor,
and you will have your treasure in heaven; and come,
follow me, and be one of my disciples."</p>

<p>When the young man heard those words, he felt
greatly disappointed, and turned away, unwilling to do
what Jesus asked, for he was very rich, and he loved his
money. After he had left them, Jesus turned to his
disciples:</p>

<p>"How hard it is," said Jesus, "for a rich man to
come into the kingdom of God!"</p>

<p>As the disciples heard this, they were greatly surprised,
for all the Jews thought that to have riches was
a sign of God's special favor. As they stood silent, not
knowing how to answer these words, Jesus said again:</p>

<p>"Children, how hard it is for those who trust in
their riches to enter into the kingdom of God! It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God!"</p>

<p>They were amazed at this, and said, "Then who
can be saved?"</p>

<p>"What is impossible with men," answered Jesus,
"is possible with God."</p>

<p>"But we," said Simon Peter, "have left everything,
and have followed you. What shall we have in the
kingdom for all this?"</p>

<p>Peter thought, as did all the crowds who were going
up to Jerusalem with Jesus, that there he would set up
his kingdom and give rich rewards to his disciples.</p>

who have followed me, in the new kingdom when the
Son of Man shall sit upon his throne, you twelve men,
my disciples, shall sit upon twelve thrones, ruling over
the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one who has left

<h2>The Workers in the Vineyard</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 69</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS EXPLAINED by a parable what he meant in
saying, "Many that are first shall be last, and some
that are lowest here will be the highest in God's
kingdom." This parable was "The Workers in the
Vineyard."</div>

<p>"There was a man," said Jesus, "who owned a
vineyard. He needed men to work in his vineyard;
and one day, early in the morning, went out to hire them.
Some men met him and agreed to work for him at fifteen
cents for each day's work; so he sent them out to his
vineyard. At about nine o'clock he was walking through
the market place, and seeing some other men standing
around, waiting for work, he said to them:</p>

<p>"'You go to work in my vineyard, and whatever is
fair, I will pay you.'</p>

<p>"He went out again at noon; he found men wanting
work and sent them also into his vineyard, saying to
them, 'Whatever are fair wages, I will pay you.' Again
at three o'clock, he found other men and sent them, too,
making them the same promise. He went into the market
place at five o'clock, almost at the end of the day,
and found some men standing there. 'Why do you
stand here doing nothing?' he said to these men. They
answered him:</p>

<p>"'We would be glad to work; but nobody is ready
to hire us.'</p>

<p>"'You go into my vineyard, too,' he said, 'and I
will pay you whatever is right.'</p>

<p>"When the evening came, the master of the vineyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
said to his foreman, 'Now call the workers together
and pay them their wages. Begin with those who came
to work last, then pay those who went into the vineyard
at three o'clock, and so on, ending with those who went
to work earliest.'</p>

<p>"So those came up first who had been hired last,
and had worked only one hour; and to each of them was
paid fifteen cents, the wages of a full day's work. When
the first came, they supposed that they would be paid
more, because they had worked longer; but each was
paid his fifteen cents, as had been agreed upon. These
men complained to the master of the vineyard.</p>

<p>"'Those men who came in last, when the day was
almost ended,' they said, 'have been made equal to us,
who have borne the hard work and the heat of the day.
That is not fair!'</p>

<p>"'My friend,' said the master to one of these men,
'I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me to
work for fifteen cents a day? Take up your wages and
go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to
you. Haven't I the right do so as I please with what
belongs to me? Are you jealous because I am generous?'</p>

<p>"So," said Jesus, "there are last who will be first;
and there are first who will be last."</p>

<p>This parable shows how God gives his rewards
differently from men. Men pay only for work that is
done; but God gives his pay to those who are <i>willing</i> to
work for him, whether they are able to work or not;
for while men look at the deed, God looks at the heart.</p>

<p>Every day Jesus was drawing nearer to Jerusalem,
and his twelve disciples with all the multitude of those
who were following him, fully expected that in Jerusalem
Jesus would reign as the King of Israel. He had told
them before, and more than once, that he was going
up to Jerusalem to die there; but their minds were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
fixed upon thrones and kingdoms and worldly power
that they could not understand his words.</p>

<p>Now Jesus called together his twelve disciples,
apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said, "We are going up to Jerusalem,
and there everything that is written in the books of the
prophets about the Son of Man shall come to pass. He
will be given up to his enemies, the chief priests and the
scribes, the teachers of the law; and they shall sentence
him to be put to death, and shall hand him over to the
Romans to be mocked and beaten and nailed to a cross to
die; and on the third day after, he will rise from the dead."</p>

<p>But the disciples did not understand what these words
meant. They were just as certain as they had been
before, that he was going up to Jerusalem to take the throne
and rule, and they even talked among themselves about
the chief offices in his kingdom and who should have
them.</p>

<p>When they were drawing near to Jerusalem, but still
in the land of Perea, a woman came to Jesus with her
two sons. This woman was named Salome; and she
was the wife of Zebedee, and the mother of James and
John, two of the leading disciples of Jesus. She bowed
low even to the ground before Jesus, and begged him to
grant her a favor.</p>

<p>"What is it that you want?" said Jesus to her.</p>

<p>"I want you to promise me," said Salome, "that in
your kingdom these two sons of mine shall sit, one on
your right hand and the other on your left."</p>

<p>"You do not know what you are asking," answered
Jesus. "Can you drink of the cup that I am to drink? Can
you receive the same baptism that is coming to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the two men said, "we can!"</p>

<p>"You shall indeed drink my cup, and be baptized
with my baptism," said Jesus. "But it is not mine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
say who shall sit on my right hand and on my left.
Those places shall be given to those whom my Father
has chosen for them."</p>

<p>By his cup and his baptism, Jesus meant his sufferings
and his death; but this James and John did not
know. When the other ten disciples heard of this they
were very angry with the two brothers for trying to get
ahead of them. But Jesus called them to him and said:</p>

<p>"You know that in the nations of this world their
rulers lord it over them, and their great men make the
people serve them. But it must not be so with you.
Whoever among you has the will to be great, let him be
a servant to the others; and whoever would be first, let
him be even as a slave. For the Son of Man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give up his life that he
may save many."</p>

<h2>The Blind Man at the Gate</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 70</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS HAD now ended his work of preaching in the
land of Perea, on the east of the Jordan. With his
disciples and a great throng of people who were
going up to the feast of the Passover at Jerusalem, he
came to the river at another Bethabara, or "the place
of the crossing," because like the Bethabara near the
Sea of Galilee, the river though very wide was very
shallow, so that people could wade across it. This
Bethabara was opposite the city of Jericho, which had
been built up and made beautiful by King Herod the
Great, about forty years before.</div>

<p>More than a thousand years before Jesus stood
beside the river, the Israelites had walked across it to
enter the land; when God held back the water. Jesus
could have walked on the water if he had chosen to do it;
but he never caused a miracle for himself, though often he
did for others. At that time some of the people going up
to Jerusalem waded across the river, holding their clothes
on their heads, while others crossed in a ferry-boat. We
are not told in which way Jesus went across the river.</p>

<p>Six miles from the river Jordan, on the west, stood
Jericho, toward which Jesus came with a great crowd of
people around him. As he drew near Jericho, a blind
man was seated beside the gate, begging for the small
coins of those who passed by. This blind man's name
was Bartimeus, a word which means "the son of
Timeus." Hearing the tramping and the voices of a
crowd, he asked why so many people were coming.
They said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jesus the Nazarene is passing by."</p>

<p>Bartimeus had heard of Jesus and his good works,
curing many that were blind and lame and lepers. He
had often wished that Jesus might pass his way and
cure him. Now, when he heard that Jesus was really
coming, he shouted out at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Jesus, son of David, have pity on me! Jesus, son
of David, have pity on me!"</p>

<p>The people who were in front told him to be quiet;
but he felt that this was the chance of his life, and he
kept on calling, "Jesus, son of David, have pity on me!"</p>

<p>Jesus stopped, and said to those near, "Go, and
bring this man to me."</p>

<p>Then they said to Bartimeus, "Be of good cheer;
get up and go to Jesus, for he is calling you!"</p>

<p>Bartimeus was in such a hurry to get to Jesus that
he sprang up, flung aside his cloak, and left it on the
ground, while they led him to the Lord. When he
came near, Jesus said to him:</p>

<p>"What would you have me do for you?"</p>

<p>"Lord," he answered, "let me have my sight
again!"</p>

<p>"Have your sight," said Jesus, "your faith has
made you well."</p>

<p>And at once his sight came back to him; and he
joined the crowd following Jesus, giving praise to God
with a loud voice. And all those who saw this wonderful
work added their praises to God.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>




<h2>In the Rich Man's Home at Jericho</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 71</div>


<div class='cap'>BUT BLIND Bartimeus was not the only man in
Jericho who was eager to meet Jesus. In that
city was living a very rich man named <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Zacc eus'">Zaccheus</ins>,
who was the head of all the tax collectors in that part
of the country. He had heard that Jesus was unlike
other Jews, in being friendly toward the tax gatherers,
and he greatly desired to see him. But Zaccheus was a
small man, and in the crowd he could have no chance to
look at Jesus, so he ran on ahead and climbed up into
a mulberry tree that stood beside the road, and from a
place among its branches he could look down upon the
passing multitude.</div>

<p>When Jesus came opposite to the tree, he stopped,
looked up and saw Zaccheus, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for I must
stop at your house today!"</p>

<p>He was surprised and glad that the great Teacher
should choose his house, out of all the homes in Jericho,
to stay in. He came down and walked with Jesus to
his house. But all the people began to find fault, saying:</p>

<p>"He has gone to visit at the house of a man who is a
sinner!"</p>

<p>For they took for granted because many of the tax
gatherers were wicked men and robbed the people, that
all of them were bad.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/illus-382.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus called out to Zaccheus in the tree: &quot;Make haste and come down, for I
must stop at your house today!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Zaccheus knew how they were feeling and what they
were saying; so he came forward, and stood before
Jesus and said:</p>

<p>"Hear me, Master! I will give half of all that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
own to help the poor; and if I have robbed or cheated
anyone, I will pay him back four times as much as he
has lost!"</p>

<p>"Today," said Jesus, "in this house a man has been
saved from his sins; since even Zaccheus here is a true
son of Abraham our father. For the Son of Man has
come to look after the lost ones and to save them."</p>

<p>As the people were listening, he went on and spoke
a parable to them; for he knew that as he was going up
to Jerusalem, they were looking for the kingdom of God
to be set up at once. This was "The Parable of the
Pounds."</p>

<p>"A certain prince," said Jesus, "was going to a
city far away, to be made a king, and then to come back
and rule over his own land. Before leaving, he called
ten of his servants, and gave to each one five hundred
dollars, and said to him, 'Trade with this until I come
back.' Then he went away.</p>

<p>"But the people of his land hated him, and sent
messengers to follow him to the distant city and to say,
'We will not have this man as our king.'</p>

<p>"However, the prince was made king and came
home to reign over his land. Then he sent for his servants
to whom he had given the money, so that he might
learn how much each one had made by buying and
selling. The first servant came and said:</p>

<p>"'My lord, the five hundred dollars which you
gave me has gained five thousand dollars.'</p>

<p>"'Well done, you good servant,' said the king,
'because you have been so wise and faithful with a
small amount, I will make you the governor over ten
cities in my kingdom.'</p>

<p>"Then came another servant, who said, 'My lord,
your five hundred dollars has made five times as much as
you gave me. Here are twenty-five hundred dollars.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Very well,' answered the king, 'you may be the
ruler over five cities.'</p>

<p>"Soon one of the servants came, saying, 'My lord,
here is your five hundred dollars, just as you gave it to
me. I have kept it safe for you, wrapped up in a napkin.
For I was afraid of you; you are such a hard, selfish
man. You pick up what you never put down; and you
reap what you do not sow.'</p>

<p>"'You worthless servant!' answered the king, 'out
of your own words will I pass judgment upon you.
You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, picking up
what I never put down, and reaping what I did not
sow! If you knew this, why then did you not put my
money into the bank? Then when I came home I could
have gotten interest upon it, the money gained by lending
it.'</p>

<p>"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take away
from him the five hundred dollars, and give it to the one
who has five thousand dollars!'</p>

<p>"'My lord,' they said, 'why, he has five thousand
dollars already! Why give it to him?'</p>

<p>"'That is the very reason why he should have it,'
said the king. 'I tell you, that to him who has, more
shall be given; and as for him who has not, even the
little that he has shall be taken away from him.'"</p>

<p>"'And now, for these enemies of mine,' the king
went on, 'those men who sent word that they would not
have me for their king, seize them, and bind them in
chains and bring them here. Let them be slain in my
sight!'"</p>

<p>With these words Jesus went onward up the mountain
road leading to Jerusalem.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Alabaster Jar</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 72</div>


<div class='cap'>FROM JERICHO to Jerusalem was a journey of
fifteen miles up the mountains by a very steep
road; a road often dangerous on account of the
robbers who were hidden among the rocks by the wayside.
But at the time of the Passover when thousands
of people were going up to the feast, it was safe, through
the crowds traveling together. Up this road Jesus
walked with his disciples and a great throng of people,
all on their way to the Passover. He did not, however,
go directly to Jerusalem, but turned aside when near
the city, and stopped at the village of Bethany for a
visit with his friends, Martha and Mary and Lazarus.
They were very, very glad to see Jesus now, for you
remember that on his last visit, some months before, he
had called Lazarus out of his tomb to live again.</div>

<p>It was on Friday, just six days before the Passover
was to be held, that Jesus came to Bethany. There, at
the house of a man named Simon, a supper was given in
honor of Jesus. This Simon had been a leper, but had
been cured by Jesus, so that he had his own reason for
showing love and honor to Jesus. At the supper, the
guests sat leaning on couches, with their heads toward
the table and their feet away from it; and those who
waited at the tables passed the food and drink around to
the guests. Among those who were serving at the table
was Martha, the sister of Lazarus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">

<span class="caption">Mary anointing Jesus&#39; feet with fragrant oil from the alabaster jar</span>
</div>

<p>On the couch standing at the head of the table was
leaning in the middle Simon, who gave the feast. On
his right hand, in the place of honor, was Jesus; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
his left was Lazarus. On the side tables were lying the
disciples of Jesus and other guests.</p>

<p>Suddenly, into the room came Mary, the sister of
Lazarus. She carried in her arms a jar made of marble,
of the kind called alabaster. Its cover was sealed; but
Mary broke the seal, and at once a rich perfume arose in
the air and floated not only through the dining hall, but
the whole house, for the jar was filled with a very
fragrant and costly oil. Mary walked up the aisle
between the tables and the couches whereon the guests
were lying. She came opposite to Jesus, and poured
some of the oil upon his head; then walked around the
couch, poured the rest of it upon his feet and wiped them
with her long hair, hanging loose upon her shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-387.jpg" width="500" height="354" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Judas secretly bargaining with the chief priests for the betrayal of Jesus
into their hands</span>
</div>

<p>Everybody in the room was surprised at Mary's
act; and one of the disciples of Jesus said aloud:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a waste this is? Why, that jar of perfume
was worth at least fifty dollars! It might have been sold
and the money given to the poor!"</p>

<p>The one who said this was Judas Iscariot, the
wicked disciple who was already planning to give up his
Lord to his enemies, the chief priests and rulers. Judas
was the treasurer for Jesus and his twelve disciples.
They all lived as one family, kept their money in one
purse, and in addition whatever money was given to
Jesus by his friends. Judas kept this purse; but he was
a thief, and stole some of the money, that he might use
it for himself. When Judas saw all the precious oil
poured upon the head and feet of Jesus, he was angry,
for he looked upon it as so much money that he might
have kept.</p>

<p>"Why do you find fault with this woman?" said
Jesus. "It is a beautiful thing that she has done to me.
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not
always have me. As she poured this perfume on my
body, she did it for my burial, which is soon to take
place. I tell you, wherever in the whole world my gospel
shall be preached, the act of this woman will be told, and
she will be remembered on account of it."</p>

<p>All the friends of Jesus were expecting him soon to
go to Jerusalem and set up his kingdom and rule. They
did not understand his words about dying and rising
from the dead. But Mary, among them all, knew that
Jesus was soon to die, and it was not only to show her
love toward him for bringing her brother to life, but in
a very tender way to put into an act what she would
not say in words, that her Lord would soon die and be
buried.</p>

<p>After this supper, Judas Iscariot, the disciple who
had spoken against Mary and her gift, quietly made up
his mind to give Jesus over to his enemies. He saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
that Jesus would not be such a king as he wished him to
be, and he had begun to fear that his stealings were
known, or at least suspected. He went secretly to the
chief priests and the rulers and said to them:</p>

<p>"What will you pay me if I will give Jesus into your
hands?"</p>

<p>They were glad to hear this, and said to him, "We
will give you thirty pieces of silver."</p>

<p>This was a little less than twenty dollars in our
money, and it was the price paid for a slave. Think of
it, for the value of a slave, the Lord of all the earth was
sold by one of his own chosen followers!</p>

<p>Judas was sharp in his dealing with the priests.
He was afraid that, after he had given Jesus up to them,
he might be cheated out of his money. So he said:</p>

<p>"Pay me the money now; and when the right time
comes, I will show you how to make Jesus of Nazareth
your prisoner."</p>

<p>They gave Judas the thirty pieces of silver; and
from that moment Judas was looking for the chance to
put Jesus into the hands of his enemies.</p>

<h2>Palm Sunday</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 73</div>


<div class='cap'>THE NEWS that Jesus was at Bethany went abroad,
and very soon the village was thronged with
people eager to see him. Many of these were men
who had come from the country up to Jerusalem for the
feast of the Passover; and most of them were ready to
believe in Jesus as the Christ, the promised King of
Israel. Some came to Bethany, not only to see Jesus,
but to see Lazarus also, the man whom Jesus had raised
from death to life. The rulers, who had already made
up their minds to put Jesus to death and had paid Judas
to give him up to them, said to each other:</div>

<p>"If we are to prevent these people from making
Jesus of Nazareth their king, it will not be enough to
kill Jesus; we must first kill Lazarus, for on his account
many are following Jesus."</p>

<p>On the morning after the supper at Simon's house,
Jesus decided to go into Jerusalem. He called two of
his disciples and said to them:</p>

<p>"Go into the next village on the road to Jerusalem,
and just on the edge of it you will find an ass tied, and
with it a colt on which no one has ever ridden; untie
them and bring them to me. If anyone asks you, 'Why
are you doing that?' tell him, 'The Master needs them;
and will send them back soon;' and he will let you take
the ass and the colt."</p>

<p>The two disciples went to the village, and found in
the street in front of a house an ass and a colt tied just
as Jesus had said. They were untying them when the
owner, who was standing by, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing, untying the ass?"</p>

<p>"The Master needs it," answered the disciples; and
when the man heard this, he allowed them to take the
ass and the colt. They brought them to Jesus at
Bethany; and on the ass-colt they laid their cloaks, to
form a cushion for Jesus; and he
sat upon the colt, which never before
had been ridden upon. Then
the crowd, seeing that Jesus was
riding toward Jerusalem, walked
with him, some going before and
some following after. Those in front spread their clothes
upon the road before Jesus; others threw on the ground
leaves from the field; while many waved branches of
palm taken from the trees beside the road.</p>
<div><img src="images/illus-391a.jpg" alt="brook top photo" width="180" height="125" class="splitr" /></div>
<div><img src="images/illus-391b.jpg" alt="brook bottom photo" width="500" height="326" class="splitr" /></div>



<p>And before they came to the top of the Mount of
Olives, which was between Bethany and Jerusalem,
another crowd of people met them, coming from the city to
see Jesus. And all the multitude shouted together:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>"God save the King, the Son of David! Blessed is
he who comes in the Lord's name! Blessed is the kingdom
of our father David! Praises be to the Lord!"</p>

<p>For all this crowd of people believed that now, at
last, the kingdom of God was to be set up, with Jesus
as Christ and King. But in the multitude were some
Pharisees, enemies of Jesus, who became very angry as
they saw the crowd waving the palm branches and cheering
for Jesus as King. These men came up to Jesus as
he was riding and said to him:</p>

<p>"Teacher, tell your followers to stop this noise!"</p>

<p>"I tell you," answered Jesus, "that if these men
should keep still, the very stones would cry out!"</p>

<p>Soon they came to the top of the Mount of Olives,
and then the Temple and the city of Jerusalem were in
sight before them.</p>

<p>As Jesus looked upon the city, the tears came into
his eyes and he said:</p>

<p>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! If only you might know,
even now, while yet there is time, what would give you
peace! But no, it is hidden from your sight! The
time is coming when your enemies will build walls and
forts around you, and shut you in on every side; and
trample you down into the dust, and your children with
you. They will not leave in you one stone standing upon
another&mdash;and all because you would not understand
when the Lord was visiting you."</p>

<p>Jesus rode down the Mount of Olives, and across the
valley of the brook Kedron. At the gate of the Temple
he got off from the back of the colt, and sent it with
the ass back to its owner. As he came into the city and
the Temple there was a great stir, the people everywhere
flocking to meet him.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" they said; and the crowds answered,
"This is the Prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Many waved branches of palm, and all the multitude shouted together: &quot;God
save the King, the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in
the Lord&#39;s name!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The Pharisees said to each other, "We can do
nothing! The whole world has gone after Jesus!"</p>

<p>Everybody, both the friends and enemies of Jesus,
looked to have him take control of the city and act as
a king. But Jesus only went into the Temple and
walked around it. By this time it was evening, and
Jesus returned with his disciples to Bethany.</p>

<p>Forty years after that time, the terrible things that
Jesus declared were to fall upon Jerusalem, did come to
pass. The Jews rose against the Romans and made
war upon them. A mighty Roman army came, and
swept over all the land, bringing ruin and death everywhere.
The Romans laid siege to Jerusalem, and built
a strong wall around it, so that no one could come out
or go in. The people fought desperately, until they were
starved and could fight no more. At last the Romans
broke into the Temple, and set the city on fire. Both
the Temple and all the city were utterly destroyed;
untold thousands of the people were slain, and many
thousands more were sold as slaves. And from that
time, seventy years after Jesus was born, and forty years
after he died on the cross, the Jews have not had of
their own a land or a city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<h2>Monday on the Mount and in the
Temple</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 74</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE royal coming of Jesus to the city and
the Temple, on the next morning&mdash;which was
Monday&mdash;Jesus left Bethany very early, without
waiting for his breakfast, and with his twelve disciples
walked over the Mount of Olives toward Jerusalem.
The walk and the early morning air made him hungry,
and seeing a fig tree covered with green leaves in a field
near the road, he went to it, hoping to find some figs
upon it.</div>

<p>The laws of the Jews allowed any person passing by
a field which was not his own, to take as much fruit or
grain as he wished to eat, but not to carry any away;
so that Jesus had a right to go to this tree and help
himself to its fruit. Jesus knew that it was not quite
the time for ripe figs, for they do not become ripe in
that country before May or June, and that day may
have been in March. But on the sunny slope of the
Mount of Olives figs often ripen early in the season and
as the figs always come before the leaves, wherever the
leaves were abundant, there might be among them some
ripe figs.</p>

<p>But when Jesus came to the fig tree, and looked at
it closely, he found that upon it was no fruit, either ripe
or green, but only leaves. Then a thought came to
Jesus, and in the presence of his disciples he spoke to
the fig tree.</p>

<p>"From this time let no fruit ever be picked from this
tree forever!" he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>This was not because Jesus was angry with the poor
tree, which could not help not having fruit. It was
because he saw in that tree a parable or picture of the
Jewish people. They made a show of serving God, and
were like trees covered with leaves; but they did not
bring forth the fruit of good lives, of love to God and
their fellow-men.
They were fruitless
trees, and
trees which have
been planted and
kept for fruit
are of no use
without fruit.</p>

<p>The twelve
disciples who were
with Jesus around
the fig tree heard
those words, and
soon had cause to
remember them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/illus-398.jpg" width="322" height="400" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">As the traders looked upon Jesus and heard his
stern rebuke, they became afraid and rushed
out of the court before him</span>
</div>

<p>From the
Mount of Olives
they walked, as
on the day before,
across the valley
of the brook
Kedron, and
again came into the Temple. You remember that two
years before when Jesus visited the Temple, he then
drove out from its court all the people that he found
buying and selling and changing money. But in the two
years that had passed, they had all come back, and the
Court of the Gentiles was again a place of business and
of confusion. All around were oxen lowing and sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
bleating; their owners calling upon the people passing
by to come and buy them; cages full of pigeons and
doves were standing on every side; and from a row of
tables might be heard the chink of silver, as the money
of foreign lands was changed for that of Judea.</p>

<p>When these traders saw Jesus standing before them,
some of them could remember how two years before he
had driven them out of the Temple, and all saw in him
the man whom only yesterday the people had welcomed
as the coming King of Israel. There was a look upon
the face of Jesus which made all these wrongdoers afraid
of him; and when he spoke in the hearing of them all,
"God's book says, 'My house shall be called a house of
prayer; but you are making it a den of robbers,'" with
one accord they rushed out of the court before him,
driving out the sheep and oxen, carrying away the
cages of doves, and even upsetting the tables of the
money-changers.</p>

<p>Jesus saw that people who were coming from outside
the wall were carrying goods and jars of water and
of oil through the Court of the Gentiles as the nearest
way to the city, so that the court was becoming merely
a street between the city and the country. He put a
stop to this carrying of loads through the Temple courts;
and would not allow even a jar of water to be taken by
way of the Temple into the city. This building in all
its parts was the house of God, and Jesus as the Son
of God gave commands that everywhere it was to be
used only for the worship of his heavenly Father.</p>

<p>After casting out all these evil things from the outer
court, Jesus walked up the steps to the inner court,
called the Treasury. There he sat down, and for the
rest of the day taught the people who crowded around
him.</p>

<p>While he was in the Treasury, they led to him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
blind, and he gave them sight by a word; and the lame
came in on crutches, or were carried in by their friends
to his feet, and he gave them power to walk. Boys too
were marching around the Temple and shouting everywhere,
"May God save the Son of David!"</p>

<p>All these things made the priests and the rulers
very angry; for they were only waiting for a chance to
find Jesus alone and make him their prisoner, and they
could do nothing while such crowds were around him, all
believing that he was the promised Son of David and
King of Israel. But these enemies of Jesus could not
keep quiet amid all these praises.</p>

<p>"Do you hear," they said to Jesus, "what these
boys are shouting? Why do you not tell them to be
still?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear them," answered Jesus, "and have you
never read what is said in the book of Psalms, 'Out of
the lips of little children, even of babies in their mothers'
arms, thy praises have been made perfect?'"</p>

<p>Jesus stayed in the Temple teaching until the
evening drew near. Then he went with his disciples
back to Bethany for the night. There among his
friends he was safe.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>




<h2>Tuesday Morning in the Temple</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 75</div>


<div class='cap'>AGAIN ON Tuesday morning of that great week, the
last week of our Saviour's life on earth, he went
with his disciples out of Bethany to go to Jerusalem.
As they were walking up the Mount of Olives,
they came to the fig tree to which Jesus had spoken on
the morning before. It was standing upon the hillside,
but withered and dead, its dry leaves turned yellow,
rustling in the wind.</div>

<p>"Master, look!" said Peter, "the fig tree to which
you spoke those words yesterday is all withered!"</p>

<p>"Have faith in God," answered Jesus. "I tell you
in truth, that if any one of you should say to this mountain
before us, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,'
and should not have in his mind a doubt, but believes
that what he says will come to pass, it shall be done.
So I say to you, whatever you pray God for, believe that
God gives it to you, and it shall be yours. But keep this
also in mind, whenever you stand up for prayer, if there
is anything that you have against anybody, forgive him.
Then, and then only, will your Father in heaven forgive
you your sins against him."</p>

<p>Again they came to Jerusalem, and walked across
the Court of the Gentiles now quiet and free from the
confusion of the morning before, no buying, no selling,
and no carrying of loads through it to the city. They
went into the Treasury, where Jesus had taught and
cured on the day before; and they found it already full
of people who had come together, hoping to listen again
to the words of the great Teacher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/illus-402.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The chief priests angrily demanded of Jesus: &quot;What right have you to come
here and act as a ruler?&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>But not only were there in the Temple
people friendly to Jesus, and eager to hear him;
the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the
members of the great council, were also there, ready
to do all in their power against him. These men
were very angry at Jesus for what he had done on
the day before. They pushed their way through
the crowds up to Jesus, and said to him, with an air of
lordship:</p>

<p>"What right have you to come here and act as a
ruler? Who gave you the right to do what you did
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I will ask you a question," answered Jesus
promptly, "and if you will answer that, then I
will tell you who has given me the right to do
what I have done here in the Temple. What do
you say about John the Baptist&mdash;did he speak the
words of God as his messenger? Or did he
speak his own words only, without authority or
power from God? Answer me that question!"</p>

<p>They were taken aback at this answer of Jesus;
and began talking together, while the crowd around
looked on.</p>

<p>"What shall we say?" they whispered to each
other. "If we say, 'John the Baptist spoke from
God,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe
his words and obey him?' No, let us say, 'He spoke
only as a man, without authority or power from
God.' But then, if we say that, the people will stone
us, for they all believe that John was a true prophet
of God."</p>

<p>So after a time these men said to Jesus, "We
cannot answer your question. We don't know
whether John spoke the words of God or his own
words."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said Jesus, "No more will I tell you who has
given me the power to do these things."</p>

<p>For Jesus well knew that if these men had
not believed when John the Baptist said, "Thus
saith the Lord," they would not believe him
saying, "I do only what my Father tells me to
do."</p>

<h2>Three Parables of Warning</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 76</div>


<div class='cap'>IMMEDIATELY after answering the question of the
priests and the rulers, Jesus gave three parables, one
directly after another; and all aimed at his enemies.
The first was "The Parable of the Two Sons."</div>

<p>"What do you think of this?" said Jesus. "There
was a man who had two sons. He went to the older
son, and said to him, 'My son, go and work in the vineyard
today.' 'Yes, sir,' said the young man. 'I will
go.' But although he had given his promise to go, he
broke it, for he did not go.</p>

<p>"Then the father spoke to his second son, as he had
spoken to the first. 'My son, go and work today in
the vineyard.' This one said to his father, 'I will not
go.' But afterward he was sorry, and went into the
vineyard to work. Now tell me, which of these two sons
did as his father told him to do?"</p>

<p>They answered him, "The second."</p>

<p>"I tell you truly," said Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers
and the bad women are going into the kingdom of
God instead of you, who believe yourselves to be better
than others. For John the Baptist came and showed
you how to live, and you would not believe him nor do
as he said. But the tax-gatherers and the bad women
believed him and turned from their evil ways to God.
And even when you saw them turning from evil to good,
you would not seek God after them and follow the words
of John."</p>

<p>Then Jesus spoke to these rulers another parable,
called "The Parable of the Wicked Vine-dressers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to another parable," he said. "A man
who owned some land planted upon it a vineyard of
grape-vines. He put a fence around it, dug a wine-vat
inside it, and built a tower in the middle of the vineyard,
so that a watchman might be on the lookout against
thieves. Then he let it out to vine-dressers, to take
care of it, and at
the time of ripe
grapes to send
him his share of
the fruit or its
worth in money.
After leasing the
vineyard, he
went away to another
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/illus-406.jpg" width="360" height="450" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Vineyard and watch-tower in Bethlehem</span>
</div>

<p>"When the
time for the vintage
drew near,
the time for gathering
the grapes,
he sent his servants
for his share
of the fruit. But
instead of giving
him what belonged
to him,
the vine-dressers seized his servants. One servant
they flogged and drove away, another they killed,
and a third they stoned. A second time the owner sent
some other servants, more than before; and the vine-dressers
treated them in the same way. And so it was
with many others; some they beat and some they
killed.</p>

<p>"The owner of the vineyard had one son, a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
man, whom he loved very dearly. Last of all he sent
this son to them, saying to himself, 'They will surely
respect my son, and will not treat him as they have
treated the servants.'</p>

<p>"But those men said, as soon as they saw him,
'This is the one who is to own the vineyard when his
father dies. Let us kill him, and then the vineyard
will be ours.' So when he came, they seized him and
killed him, and flung his body outside the vineyard.</p>

<p>"Now, I will ask you," said Jesus, "when the owner
of that vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"</p>

<p>They answered, "He will utterly destroy those vile,
cruel men, and will lease his vineyard to other vine-dressers,
who will give him every year his share of the
fruit."</p>

<p>"Have you never read this verse," said Jesus.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The stone which the builders refused<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Has now become the chief and corner-stone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the work of the Lord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And it is wonderful in our sight?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I tell you," added Jesus, "that the kingdom of
God shall be taken from you and given to a people that
brings to God its fruits. Yes, and he who falls on this
stone shall be dashed to pieces; and whoever this stone
falls on shall be ground to powder!"</p>

<p>As the chief priests and Pharisees and rulers heard
these parables, they knew at once that they were spoken
against them. They were eager to seize Jesus, but were
afraid of the crowds around, for all the common people
looked upon him as a prophet speaking God's word.</p>

<p>Jesus gave a third parable: that of "The Marriage
of the King's Son." This, given in the Temple, was in
some parts like another, "The Parable of the Great
Feast," which he had already given in Perea; but other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
parts of it, as we shall see, were different from that
parable.</p>

<p>"There was a certain king," said Jesus, "who gave
a great supper at the marriage of his son. He sent out
his servants to those who had been invited to the feast,
but they would not come. Once again he sent some
other servants, and told them to say to the guests:</p>

<p>"'Here is my supper all ready, the oxen and fat
cattle have been killed; everything is ready; come to
the feast.'</p>

<p>"But they paid no attention to his words, and went
off, one to his farm and another to his shop. And some
seized his servants, ill-treated them and even killed them.
This made the king very angry. He sent his army, put
those murderers to death and burned up their city.</p>

<p>"Then the king said to his servants, 'The marriage
feast is ready; but those who were the invited guests
were not fit for it. Go out into the streets of the city
and the roads in the country, and ask everybody whom
you meet to come to the wedding.' The servants went
forth into the roads, and brought to the feast all whom
they met, both the bad and the good. So the marriage
supper had plenty of guests.</p>

<p>"When the king came in to meet the guests, he saw
a man among them who was not wearing a wedding robe.
For as each guest came to the house, a beautiful robe was
given him, to be worn at the supper.</p>

<p>"'My friend,' said the king to this man, 'how was
it that you came in here without a wedding robe?'</p>

<p>"The man stood silent, for he had nothing to say.
Then said the king to his servants:</p>

<p>"'Tie this man hand and foot, and throw him out
of doors into the darkness. There men will wail and
gnash their teeth. For I tell you that many are invited,
but few are chosen.'"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Head on the Coin</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 77</div>


<div class='cap'>THE ENEMIES of Jesus thought that, perhaps,
they might lead him to say some words against
the Roman rulers over the land. If he would do
this, then they could complain to the Roman governor
and cause Jesus
to be seized
and put in
prison, or even
slain, as an
enemy of the
Roman state.
These priests
and Pharisees
and rulers
themselves hated
the Romans,
and would
gladly throw off
the Roman yoke
if they dared to
do it; but they
were willing to
pretend friendliness
to their
Roman masters,
if only through them they could destroy Jesus.</div>

<span class="caption">The head on the coin</span>
</div>

<p>With this purpose in mind, while Jesus was in the
Temple on that Tuesday morning, they sent to him some
men whom Jesus had never met, men who seemed honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and true; for they knew that if they came themselves
Jesus would at once see through their plans and be on his
guard against them. They did not know that Jesus
as the Son of God knew all things, could look into every
heart of man and read all their thoughts.</p>

<p>So these men came to Jesus in the Temple and
tried at first to speak flattering words to him to win his
favor.</p>

<p>"Teacher," they said, "we know that you are
honest and speak the truth; that you are not afraid of
anybody and do not try to please men, but say only
what is right. There is a question that troubles us,
for we do not know how to meet it. For that reason
we bring it to you, for we know
that you will give us a right
answer. Tell us now what
you think about it. Is it right
for our people to pay taxes
to the Roman rulers over the
land? Shall we pay, or shall we refuse to pay?"</p>

<span class="caption">Silver coin of Tiberius Cæsar</span>
</div>

<p>This was indeed a hard question to answer, especially
to answer at once, without time for thinking about it.
For if Jesus should say, "Do not pay the tax," the
Romans would arrest him as an enemy to their rule,
and might even put him to death, as they had seized
and slain many for this very act of refusing to pay the
taxes. At that very time hundreds of men were hiding
from the Romans in caves and forests, trying to escape
from paying this tax. On the other hand, if Jesus should
say, "Pay the tax," all the common people would turn
against him; for all the Jews hated this tax, which was
a sign of the Roman power over them; and every
man among them only paid it because he was
afraid of the Roman governor and the Roman
soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jesus saw through all their plots and plans,
and he had his answer ready.</p>

<p>"You men of false heart, pretending to be honest!"
he said, "why do you try to catch me in a snare? Let
me see some of the tax money!"</p>

<p>They brought to him a piece of silver, a Roman
coin. He looked at it closely and then asked:</p>

<p>"Whose head is this that I find upon the coin?
What are the words around the edge?"</p>

<p>"Why, that is the head of the Roman emperor,
Tiberius Cæsar, and those words are his title."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Jesus, "give to Cæsar what
belongs to Cæsar; and be sure to give to God what
belongs to God."</p>

<p>There was nothing in that answer which they could
make to appear either unfriendly or friendly to the
Roman rule; nor yet was there anything that could be
used against Jesus with the people. Wondering at the
answer of Jesus, these men left him.</p>

<h2>The Woman with Seven Husbands</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 78</div>


<div class='cap'>WE HAVE heard much in the story, of the Pharisees,
who were looked upon as leaders of the people
in religion, because they regularly went to
church, paid the church dues and obeyed all the rules,
foolish as some of those rules seemed. These Pharisees,
as you know, were bitter enemies of Jesus, and everywhere
stirred up the people against him.</div>

<p>But there was another party among the Jews, the
Sadducees, whom we have not mentioned up to this
time. These people were equally opposed to the Pharisees
and to Jesus. They were easy-living men, not paying
much attention to the church rules; and in fact not going
often to the church, which you know was called "the
synagogue." But although they cared little for the
churches in the different towns, they cared greatly for
the Temple in Jerusalem, for most of the priests in the
Temple were Sadducees, as also were many of the rulers
in the great council of the Jews.</p>

<p>The Sadducees did not believe that there was any
soul in man, nor any life after this life, nor any angels,
nor any rising from the dead hereafter, nor any heaven
or hell. They believed that when a man died and was
buried, that was his end forever.</p>

<p>Some of these Sadducees tried to puzzle Jesus with
a question. They came to him in the Temple that
Tuesday while he was speaking to the people.</p>

<p>"Teacher," they said to him, "you remember that
in the law of Moses it is ordered that if a man should
die without any children, but leaving a wife, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
man's brother shall take the widow for his wife, and raise
a family for his brother. Well, there were living seven
brothers. The oldest of these married a wife, and after
a time died, leaving no children. Then the second
married her, and he too died without a child. The
third took her and died, the fourth also, and all the
rest of the seven died, leaving no children. Finally
the woman herself died. Now, you have been teaching
that there will come a day when the dead shall rise to
life. When that day comes, and these seven men rise,
all of whom were married to this woman, whose wife
out of them all will she be, for every one of them in turn
was married to her?"</p>

<p>"You make a mistake," answered Jesus, "because
you do not understand the teachings of the Bible; nor
do you know how great is the power of God, who can at a
word call the dead up to life. In this world men and
women marry because they live on earth only for a time,
and must have families to live after them. But when
the dead are raised up, they do not rise as husbands and
wives, nor do they marry in that world to come, for they
will have no need to raise up families to take their places.
In that land all live forever, like the angels of God.
And as to the resurrection, the rising from the dead,
have you not read the words that God spoke to Moses
at the burning bush?</p>

<p>"'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.'</p>

<p>"Now God is not the God of dead men, but of living
men. For in the sight of God all men are alive, even
after they have died on earth."</p>

<p>While Jesus was answering these questions&mdash;that
of the rulers of the Temple about his right to drive out
those that were buying and selling; that of the Pharisees
about the paying of taxes; and that of the Sadducees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
about the resurrection, the rising from the dead&mdash;the
people were standing around, listening. Although the
rulers were enemies of Jesus, the common people were
friendly, and heard him gladly. They saw how ready
and how apt his answers were, and they were greatly
pleased to find the enemies of Jesus put to confusion
before him.</p>

<h2>The Greatest of All the Commandments</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 79</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE JESUS was talking in the Temple and
answering all these questions, a teacher of the
law was standing near and listening. He saw
how well Jesus answered all the questions put to him,
and coming up to him, said:</div>

<p>"Teacher, what commandment stands first of all?"</p>

<p>We might suppose that he was speaking of the Ten
Commandments and asking which of these is the most
important. But that was not his purpose. He was
thinking, not of the commandments given by God, but
of the rules made by the scribes. One teacher would
say that the rules about keeping the Sabbath were the
greatest, another that the rules about washing were first;
and so on, each scribe or teacher laying stress on one
set of rules above another. Jesus looked upon all these
little laws made by men as of no importance; and this
was his answer to the scribe who had asked the question:</p>

<p>"The first and greatest of all the commandments
is this, 'Hear, O ye people of Israel; the Lord our God
is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,
and with all thy strength.' And the second commandment
is this, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'
There is no other commandment greater than these two."</p>

<p>To love God with all the heart is to do God's will,
not because we must do it, but because we love to do it
and find joy in doing it. And to love our neighbor
means to feel an interest in our fellow-men and to do for
them whatever we would wish to have them do for us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right, Teacher!" said the scribe in answer
to Jesus. "It is true, as you say, that there is one God;
and there is no other God besides him. And to love God
with the whole heart, and with the whole mind, and with
the whole strength; and to love one's fellow-man as one's
self&mdash;this is far beyond all offerings upon the altar!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-416.jpg" width="500" height="338" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Ruins at the place where Jesus foretold the destruction of Jerusalem</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus saw that this man's words were true and good
and that he had the right thought of our duty to God
and to our fellow-man. He said to him:</p>

<p>"You are not far from the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>This was the last question put to Jesus. No one
ventured to ask him any more, for they were afraid of
his wonderful answers. The chief priests and the rulers
were more and more angry at him, but the common
people listened to him willingly.</p>

<p>While Jesus was teaching he in his turn asked a
question of the Pharisees and teachers of the law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "what you think of the Messiah-Christ,
the King of Israel, promised to come. Whose
son is he?"</p>

<p>They answered at once, "David's son."</p>

<p>"How is it then," asked Jesus again, "that David
in one of the psalms calls him 'Lord'?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Until I put your enemies under your feet.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"If David calls this coming Christ 'my Lord,' how
can he be David's son?"</p>

<p>This they could not answer, and they dared not ask
Jesus any more questions. But we know, from the words
of the New Testament, that while Christ as a man was
sprung from David's line, as the Son of God he was
David's Lord.</p>

<p>After this Jesus spoke strong words to the priests,
the scribes, and the rulers, for their wickedness of life
for their leading the people away from God's will, and
for their unjust, cruel purpose to put him to death. He
told them that for their sins and the sins of their people,
the Temple should be thrown down, the city of Jerusalem
should be destroyed, and the land should be made
desolate. These were his last words, and when he had
spoken them, he rose up to go out of the Temple.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Greatest Gift; and the Strangers
from Afar</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 80</div>


<div class='cap'>THE ROOM in the Temple where Jesus spoke on
that Tuesday, the last day of his teaching in
public, was called "The Treasury," because beside
its walls were chests or boxes in which people who came
to worship placed their money for gifts to pay for the
offerings of poor people. As Jesus rose up to leave the
room, he noticed the people dropping their money into
these boxes. Some rich men made a show of giving large
sums of money, letting it make a noise as they dropped
it slowly, piece after piece, into the box.</div>

<p>There came in a poor woman, whose dress showed
that she was a widow; and she dropped into the box
two little copper coins, worth together only a quarter
of a cent. Jesus saw her, and calling his disciples, he
said:</p>

<p>"I tell you in truth, that in the sight of God this
poor widow has put into the box more money than any
of the others. All the rest have been putting in money
that they could spare and did not need. But she in her
need gave all that she had, her whole living!"</p>

<p>Then Jesus walked out of the Treasury through
the door on the east, which was so richly decorated that
it was called "The Beautiful Gate," his disciples with
him. They stepped down into the Court of the Gentiles;
and at the foot of the stairs met a number of men whose
looks and dress showed that they were not Jews, but
foreigners. These men were Greeks, from a land far
away. They were waiting for Jesus at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
stairs, for not being Jews they were forbidden to enter
the inner courts of the Temple.</p>

<p>These Greeks stepped up to one of the twelve
disciples, Philip, who had come from Bethsaida in the
north of Galilee, and could speak their language.</p>

<p>"Sir," they
said to Philip,
"we would like
to meet Jesus."</p>

<p>Philip was
not sure whether
his Master
would be willing
to talk to these
men; for Jews
kept Gentiles or
foreigners at a
distance, would
never eat with
them, and would
scarcely speak
with them.
Philip thought
that Andrew,
the brother of
Peter, might
know whether
to bring these
men to Jesus or not, so he spoke to Andrew, and Andrew
took the lead in coming to Jesus with the Greeks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/illus-419.jpg" width="379" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The poor widow drops in two little coins</span>
</div>

<p>"The time has now come," said Jesus, "for the Son
of Man to be lifted up, and to die. For it is only by dying
that I can bring forth fruit. When a kernel of wheat
is dropped into the ground, unless its outside shell dies,
it lives alone; but if it dies, then it becomes a seed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
brings a harvest of many kernels of wheat. He who
loves his life and keeps it, loses it; but he who takes no
care of his life here shall have it forever. If any man is
ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am
going there shall my servant be with me. If any one is
my servant, he shall have honor from my Father."</p>

<p>At that moment it came to the mind of Jesus that
in less than three days he would be hanging dead upon
the cross. For an instant the thought gave him pain.
"I am deeply troubled, and have sorrow in my heart,"
said Jesus, "and what can I say? Shall I say, 'Father,
save me from the hour that is coming so soon?' No, I
will not say that, because it was for that hour of death
on the cross that I have lived even until now. I will say,
'Father, give honor to thine own name!'"</p>

<p>Then a voice from heaven was heard, saying, "I have
honored my name already, and I will honor it once
more."</p>

<p>The people standing around said, "That was a peal
of thunder just now."</p>

<p>"No," said others, "it was an angel speaking to this
man!"</p>

<p>"It was not on my account that the voice came,"
said Jesus, "but on your account. Soon will come the
hour when God will judge this world, and the prince of
evil, who rules this world, shall be driven away."</p>

<p>Then Jesus thought of his coming death on the
cross; what it was to bring to the world; how that
everywhere after his death men should believe on him as
their Lord and Saviour; not only Jews, but Greeks, and
people of every land; and he said:</p>

<p>"And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will
draw all men to me."</p>

<p>Soon after this Jesus walked out of the Temple,
never again to set his foot within it.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus Telling of Dark Days to Come</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 81</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS WALKED across the Court of the Gentiles
or Strangers, the large outer court of the Temple,
toward the Mount of Olives. On that side of the
court stood Solomon's Porch, a double row of pillars,
having a roof above to shield it from the sun. Under
this porch they stepped down a marble staircase to pass
out of the Temple grounds through a gate called "The
Golden Gate." As they drew near this gate the disciples
called his attention to the great stones in the wall, the
pillars and the splendid buildings around.</div>

<p>"Are you looking at these stones and buildings?"
said Jesus. "I tell you now, that the time is coming,
and not far away, when all of these stones shall be torn
apart, and of these fine buildings not one stone shall be
left standing in its place; all shall be thrown down!"</p>

<p>The disciples heard these words with alarm and
sadness. They knew that their Lord spoke as a prophet;
and whatever he said would be sure to come to pass.
But they looked upon Jerusalem as the holy city, and
upon the Temple as the house of God. To them, the fall
of the city and the Temple seemed like the end of the
whole world. They walked after Jesus in silence across
the valley of the brook Kedron and up the steep sides
of the Mount of Olives. On its top they sat down to
rest, and looked over the valley at the city, its towers
and roofs rising in their view. While they were sitting
on the mountain, Peter and Andrew, with the brothers
James and John, came to Jesus, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Tell us, Master, what your words mean, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
these terrible things will come to pass? Are you going
away, and then coming back again? How may we know
when to look for you?"</p>

<p>Then, sitting on the mountain, with the twelve
disciples around him, Jesus gave a long talk about the
things that were to come. He began by warning them
against following after men claiming to be Christ, the
King of Israel.</p>

<p>"Take care," he said, "that no one lead you astray.
For many will come saying,
'I am Christ, the
King of Israel,' and they
will lead away many people.
But do not follow
any of these false Christs.</p>

<p>"You will hear of
wars that have come, and
reports of wars that are
coming; but do not be
frightened. These must
come, but they are not
the end. Nation shall
make war with nation,
and kingdom against kingdom;
and you shall hear
of earthquakes in many places; and times shall come
when there will be no bread for the hungry to eat.
But all these are only the beginnings of the trouble; and
the worst is yet to come.</p>

<span class="caption">The Golden Gate, on east of the Temple
Area, Jerusalem (now closed)</span>
</div>

<p>"But before these take place there are some other
sufferings that you must meet because you are my
disciples. Enemies will rise up against you. You shall
be brought before councils and courts to be tried; you
shall be seized and beaten in the churches of the Jews;
you shall stand before governors and kings to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
account for yourselves as my followers. But when
they seize you and bring you to be tried, do not be anxious
as to what you shall speak; for the right words shall be
given you in that hour of trial. It will not be you that
speak, but the Spirit of God that speaks through you.</p>

<p>"In those times of trial fathers and mothers shall
turn against their children, and brothers shall give up
brothers who believe in me. Some of you shall be put
to death in those days. And all men shall hate you
because you are my disciples. But if you are faithful
to the end, even to death, you shall be saved to everlasting
life."</p>

<img src="images/illus-423.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">The Mount of Olives from Gethsemane</span>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus told of the terrible times that were
coming to Jerusalem and the land of the Jews. He said:</p>

<p>"When you see great armies encamped on these
hills all around Jerusalem, then know that the time has
come for the city and the Temple to be destroyed. Let
this be a sign for everyone in Judea to hide among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
mountains. If a man at that time is on the roof of his
house, let him not go down to take anything out of his
house; nor a man in the field go home after his cloak;
but hasten away just as he is, with the clothes that are
upon his back, and find a safe hiding-place.</p>

<p>"If anyone tells you in such times as those, 'Here is
Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it, for false Christs
will come and false prophets will appear; and they will
show signs and wonders, so as to lead astray even some
of God's own people. I tell you truly that many who are
now living shall see all these things come to pass."</p>

<p>Jesus had already told his disciples that he was soon
going away to leave them, but in his own time he would
come again. He now spoke about his "coming again."</p>

<p>"As to the coming of the Son of Man, no one knows
about that day or hour; no man knows when it will be,
nor the angels, nor even the Son himself, but only the
Father. It will be then as it was in the days of Noah;
they went on eating and drinking, marrying and being
married, until the day Noah went into the ark; and they
took no notice until the flood came and swept them all
away.</p>

<p>"So will it be when the Son of Man comes. Then
there will be two men working together in the field; one
shall be taken and the other left. Two women will be
grinding grain with the hand mill; one shall be taken
and the other left. Keep on the watch then, for you
never know what day the Lord will come. Be sure of
this, if the owner of the house had known at what time
in the night the thief would come, he would have been
on the watch for him, and would never have allowed
his house to be broken into. So be ready all the time,
for when you least expect him, the Son of Man will
come."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 82</div>


<div class='cap'>AT THE CLOSE of a long talk with the disciples, on
the Mount of Olives, Jesus gave three parables.
The first parable was to show that his followers
must watch and be ready for his sudden coming. It is
"The Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids."</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus-425.png" width="250" height="160" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Oriental lamp</span>
</div>

<p>"The coming of the Lord in his kingdom," said
Jesus, "will be as when ten girls, the bridesmaids at a
wedding, took their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom with his friends, and go with them to the
house of the bride. Five of these girls were foolish and
thoughtless, and five of them
were wise. The foolish young
women brought their lamps, but
never thought that they would
need more oil to fill their lamps
again. But each of the five wise
girls carried a small flask of oil
to refill her lamp when needed.</p>


<p>"As the bridegroom, the young man who was to be
married, was late in coming, the ten bridesmaids grew
sleepy, and finally all fell asleep. They slept until
midnight, when suddenly they were awakened by the
shout, 'Here comes the bridegroom! Come out to
meet him!'</p>

<p>"Then all the girls got up and began trimming their
lamps. The careless, foolish ones said to the wise and
thoughtful ones:</p>

<p>"'Come, let us have some of your oil. Our lamps
are going out.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the wise bridesmaids answered them, 'No,
each one of us has brought just enough oil for her own
lamp. If we should divide our oil with you, then none
of us would have enough to keep her lamp burning and
we should all be in the dark together. You must go to
the store and buy for yourselves!'</p>

<img src="images/illus-426.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The coming of the bridegroom</span>
</div>

<p>"So, in the middle of the night, while the bridegroom
was coming, those foolish women had to go to
the town, and wake up the oil-sellers and buy more oil.
While they were on their way buying oil, the bridegroom
and his party came; and the bridesmaids who were
ready went with them to the marriage-supper. When
they were all inside the room, the door was shut to keep
out strangers who had no right to enter.</p>

<p>"After a time, the rest of the bridesmaids came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and found the door shut. They called out to the bridegroom:</p>

<p>"'Oh, sir, oh, sir! Please open the door for us!'</p>

<p>"But he answered them, 'I tell you, I do not know
who you are!'</p>

<p>"So," said Jesus, "I say to you, keep on the watch,
and be ready at all times, for you do not know either the
day or the hour when your Lord will come."</p>

<h2>The Parable of the Talents</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 83</div>


<div class='cap'>THE SECOND of the three parables with which
Jesus closed his long talk to his disciples on the
Mount of Olives was "The Parable of the Talents."
In some parts it was like "The Parable of the Pounds,"
given to the crowd at Jericho only a week before, but in
other parts it was different. In that parable, there was
a king, going to a distant city to have a kingdom given
to him. In this parable, it was a rich man going on a
long journey. In the parable of the Pounds, all the
servants began with the same amount of money; in this
parable, they received different amounts, one of them
five times as much as another received. In the parable
of the Pounds, one gained ten times, the other five times
what had been given to him; and they obtained different
rewards, one the ruler over ten cities, another over five.
But in the parable of the Talents, each faithful servant
doubled what he had received, and both had the same
reward. But we will give the parable of the Talents,
and you can see how it differs from the parable of the
Pounds. Jesus said:</div>

<p>"When the Son of Man comes, it will be as when a
man returned from his journey into a far country.
Before starting out upon his journey, this man called
together his servants and gave his money into their
charge. To one he gave five talents, to another two,
and to another one. Each talent was worth about two
thousand dollars, so that the first servant had ten thousand
dollars, the second four thousand dollars, and the
third two thousand dollars. To each man was given as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
much as his master thought that he was able to take
care of. They were to use the money and gain with it
until their master should come home again; and then
bring it with their gains to him. After dividing his
money, the man went away.</p>

<p>"At once the servant who had the five talents or
ten thousand dollars, went to trade with his money, and
made with it ten thousand dollars more, or twenty
thousand dollars in all. The second servant, who had
two talents or four thousand dollars, also used his money
carefully, and doubled it, making eight thousand dollars.
But the third servant, to whom had been given one
talent, or two thousand dollars, instead of making use
of his master's money, went away and dug a hole in the
ground, and put the talent into the hole and left it there.</p>

<p>"After a long time the master of the servants came
home again, and called for his servants, to see what each
had gained. The one who had received the five talents
came with bags of gold in his arms. He said:</p>

<p>"'My lord, you gave me ten thousand dollars.
Here they are, and ten thousand dollars more, which I
have gained with your money.'</p>

<p>"'Well done, you good servant!' said his master.
'You have done well in small things; now I will give
you great things; come and share your master's feast!'</p>

<p>"Then came the second servant, to whom had been
given two talents.</p>

<p>"'My lord,' said he, 'you trusted me with four
thousand dollars. See, here it is with four thousand
dollars more that I have gained for you!'</p>

<p>"'Well done, you good servant,' said his master.
'You too have done well in small things; now I will
give you great things; come and share the feast
with me!'</p>

<p>"Then came the servant to whom had been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
one talent, two thousand dollars. In his hand was the
same bag of gold that he had received, and no more.</p>

<p>"'Sir,' he said, 'I knew that you were a hard man,
reaping where you never sowed, and taking grain that
you did not harvest. So I was afraid, and hid your
money in the
ground. Look,
here is what belongs
to you.'</p>

<p>"'You lazy,
worthless servant!'
said his
master. 'You
knew, did you,
that I reap where
I did not sow,
and that I take
grain that I did
not harvest? If
you knew that I
am such a man as
that, you should
have put my
money into the
savings bank; and
then at least I
might have had my own money with some gain added
to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/illus-430.jpg" width="317" height="400" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;You lazy, worthless servant!&quot; said his master</span>
</div>

<p>"'Therefore,' the master went on, 'take away the
talent from this man, and give it to the one who has
brought me the ten talents, the twenty thousand dollars;
for that shows that he is fitted to take care of it. For
to every one that has, more shall be given and still more.
But from him that does not have, even that which he has
shall be taken away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And as for that good-for-nothing servant, turn
him out of doors from the feast, into the darkness outside;
there those who cannot come into the feast shall
wail and gnash their teeth.'"</p>

<p>From this parable, as well as the parable of the
Pounds, it is plain that by "every one who has," the
Lord meant "every one who cares for and makes use of
what he has"; and by "him who has not" he meant
"the one who makes no use of what he has." Whoever
uses rightly what he has, whether money, or knowledge,
or powers of mind, or the chance to do good, will find
more and more of it; and whoever neglects what he has
will surely lose it.</p>

<h2>The Last Great Day</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 84</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER THE two parables of "The Bridesmaids"
and "The Talents," Jesus still with his disciples
on the Mount of Olives, gave one more parable;
a picture of "The Last Great Day." He said:</div>

<p>"When the Son of Man shall come again to earth,
in all his glory as King, and with him all the angels of
God, then he will take his seat upon his royal throne;
and before him shall be gathered all the people of the
world to be judged. At that time he will send out his
angels and they shall divide the great multitude into two
parts, as a shepherd divides his flock, putting the sheep
on his right hand and the goats on his left. Then the
King shall say to those on his right hand:</p>

<p>"'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Come,
and take the kingdom made ready for you ever since the
beginning of the world. For, when I was hungry, you
gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink;
when I was a stranger, you opened your doors and took
me into your homes; when I had no clothes, you gave me
clothing; when I was sick, you cared for me; when I was
in prison, you came to visit me.'</p>

<p>"Then the good will answer, 'When was it that we
found you hungry and gave you food? Or thirsty and
gave you drink? When did we see you a stranger, and
took you into our homes? Or without clothes, and gave
you clothing? When did we see you sick, or in prison,
and went to visit you?'</p>

<p>"And the King will answer them, 'I tell you, as often
as you did any of these things to one of these my brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
who believe in me, even the least of them, you did it
to me.'</p>

<p>"Then the King will turn to those on his left hand,
and will say to them:</p>

<p>"'Go away from me, you whom God has cursed, to
the everlasting fires which have been kindled for the
Devil and his angels, the wicked spirits. There shall be
your home forever! For I was hungry, but you never
gave me food; I was thirsty, but you never gave me
drink; I was a stranger, but you never opened your doors
to me; I was in need of clothes, but you never gave
me any; I was sick and in prison, but you never cared
for me.'</p>

<p>"Then these will answer him:</p>

<p>"'Lord, when did we ever see you hungry, or thirsty,
or a stranger, or without clothing, or sick, or in prison,
and did not help you?'</p>

<p>"And he shall answer them, 'In very truth I say to
you, that as often as you did not help in their need these
my brothers who believe in me, even the very least of
them, you did not help me.' So these will go away to
suffer punishment forever; but those who have done the
right will go to life everlasting."</p>

<p>It was now late on Tuesday afternoon, and Jesus
with his disciples went down the Mount of Olives to
Bethany. On the way he said to them:</p>

<p>"You know that two days from now is the Feast of
the Passover. On that day the Son of Man will be given
up to his enemies; and they shall put him to death upon
the cross."</p>

<p>But, although he had spoken of this many times, even
now they could not believe it. They went together to
Bethany, to the home of Martha and Mary and Lazarus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<h2>Washing the Disciples' Feet</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 85</div>


<div class='cap'>TUESDAY HAD been a busy day for Jesus, as we
have already seen; but Wednesday must have
been a quiet day, for none of the four gospels tells
us of any events taking place on that day. Jesus knew
that in two days more his sufferings were to begin, and
he needed Wednesday, his last full day, for rest and for
talking with his Father in heaven. On Wednesday,
therefore, Jesus was alone with God, not talking much
with his disciples.</div>

<p>On Thursday evening was to be held by all the Jews
the great Feast of the Passover. This kept in mind the
day, more than a thousand years before, when the Israelites
went out of Egypt and became a free people. At that
time each Israelite family in Egypt killed a lamb, roasted
it, and ate it, their last meal in Egypt; and with it they
ate "unleavened bread," that is, bread made without
yeast; somewhat like soda biscuit. In memory of that
day, the families of Israel went up to Jerusalem every
year in the spring and ate a dinner of roasted lamb with
unleavened bread, which they called "The Feast of the
Passover," because on that night in Egypt the angel of
death "passed over" the homes of the Israelites, while he
brought death to the families of Egypt.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, Peter and John came to
Jesus in Bethany and said:</p>

<p>"Master, where shall we make ready the passover
feast for you?"</p>

<p>"Go into the city," answered Jesus, "and you will
meet a man carrying a jar of water; follow him, and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
whatever house he goes, say to the man living there,
'The Teacher says, I must eat the passover at your house
tonight with my disciples&mdash;where is my room?' And this
man will show you a large room upstairs; there make
ready all things for the supper."</p>

<p>Peter and John went from Bethany into the city as
they were told; they met the man with the water jar
and followed him to the house. There they found the
owner of the house, and spoke to him as Jesus had said.
This man may have been a follower of Jesus, glad to have
his Master take a meal at his house. He led Peter and
John upstairs into a large room, with tables standing,
and around them couches for the guests.</p>

<p>Then the two disciples went into the market and
bought a lamb. This they carried upon their shoulders
to the Temple. There it was killed and its blood was
poured out at the foot of the great altar. The lamb was
then roasted in an oven; and after sunset it was brought
to the supper room and placed upon the table. Beside
it were the flat biscuits of unleavened bread, and also
some vegetables of a slightly bitter taste, to be eaten with
the lamb.</p>

<p>Late on Thursday afternoon Jesus and the rest of his
disciples left Bethany. Jesus alone knew that this was his
last farewell to that home and its loving people; but he
said nothing, not wishing to alarm them. Among his
followers on that afternoon was Judas Iscariot, knowing
that he had sold his Master to his enemies, and that the
thirty silver pieces were even then in his money bag.
Jesus knew it, too, but he said not a word of it, either to
Judas or the disciples.</p>

<p>They went around the Mount of Olives, crossed the
valley, and came through one of the gates into the city;
then found their way among the streets on Mount Zion
to the house where in the upper room the supper was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
ready for them. Here, as many times before, arose a
little quarrel over the question as to which of the twelve
disciples should sit at the guest table with Jesus, for that
table was the place of honor. Jesus stopped the dispute
by saying to them what he had said before:</p>

<p>"He that would be greatest among you, let him take
the lowest place; and he who would be chief, let him
become your servant. But there is no need for you to be
anxious about places. You have stood by me through
all my trials, and I will give you all high places in my
kingdom, for you shall sit on twelve thrones, each of you
over one of the tribes of Israel."</p>

<p>But Jesus in teaching his disciples lowliness of mind
and unselfishness of spirit, did not stop with words. He
taught them by an act which made them wonder. Just
before the supper, he rose from the couch where he was
lying, took off his robe and outer garments, then tied a
towel around his waist, poured water into a basin, and
began to wash the feet of the disciples as they were reclining
around the tables, their heads toward the tables, their
feet away from them. Jesus came first to Simon Peter,
and stood at his feet, holding the basin of water. Peter
looked up at him, and saw that the Saviour was preparing
to wash his feet.</p>

<p>"What, Master!" said Peter. "Are you going to
wash my feet?"</p>

<p>"You do not understand now what this means,"
said Jesus, "but you will learn after a time."</p>

<p>"You, my Lord, shall never wash my feet!" said
Peter.</p>

<p>"Unless I wash you," answered Jesus, "you are not
one of mine."</p>

<p>"Then, Master," said Peter, "if that be so, wash not
only my feet, but my hands and my head!"</p>

<p>"He who has already bathed," said Jesus, "is clean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and needs only to wash his feet. And you are clean&mdash;but
not every one of you."</p>

<p>In those words "not every one of you," he was thinking
of Judas, the traitor, who was there with the others.</p>

<p>So Jesus washed Peter's feet and wiped them dry
with the towel around his waist; and he went around
the couches, washing the feet
of every disciple, even the
feet of wicked Judas.
When he had finished, he
took off the towel, and put on
his outer clothes, and took
again his place at the table.</p>

<p>"Do you understand the
meaning of what I have
done to you?" said Jesus.
"You call me your Teacher
and your Lord, and you are
right, for I am both Teacher
and Lord. Well, if I, who
am your Teacher and your
Lord, have washed your
feet, you ought to wash
each other's feet. I have
set you an example, that
you should do what I have
done to you. I tell you
truly, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a
messenger greater than the one who sends him. If you
know all this, you are happy if you do them."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/illus-438.jpg" width="241" height="400" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">After taking the piece of bread, Judas
at once went out into the night</span>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus went on, saying, "When I say 'you' I do
not mean all of you; for there is one of you eating with
me now who will give me up to my enemies. Truly,
truly, I tell you one of you shall betray me!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/illus-439.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Then Jesus took up the cup and blessed it, and gave it also to his disciples.</span>
</div>

<p>As Jesus said this his face showed that he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
deep trouble. The disciples looked at each other, not
knowing of whom Jesus was speaking. They too were
filled with sorrow, and began to say to him, all around the
table, "Is it I, Lord?"</p>

<p>"One of you that puts his hand into the same dish
with me," answered Jesus, "is the traitor. The Son of
Man goes from earth, as has been written of him in the
Scripture, but woe, woe to that man who betrays his
Lord! It would have been well for that man if he had
never been born!"</p>

<p>Next to Jesus at the table was reclining one of the
disciples, John, whom Jesus loved greatly. Simon Peter
made signs to John, which meant, "Find out who it is
that he is speaking of."</p>

<p>So John leaned back on Jesus' shoulder and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Who is it, Master?"</p>

<p>"It is the one," answered Jesus, "to whom I shall
hand this piece of bread, after dipping it in the dish."</p>

<p>Jesus dipped the bread into the dish holding the
roasted lamb, and handed it to Judas Iscariot. At that
moment the spirit of evil went fully into the heart of
Judas. Jesus said to him:</p>

<p>"What you are going to do, do at once."</p>

<p>But no one at the table understood what these words
meant. As Judas kept the purse for the company, they
thought that Jesus was telling him to buy some things for
the feast, or perhaps to give some money to the poor.
After taking the piece of bread, Judas at once went out
into the night.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Lord's Supper</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 86</div>


<div class='cap'>WHILE THEY were eating the passover meal,
Jesus took a loaf of bread, and holding it in his
hand, with his eyes lifted to heaven, spoke a
blessing upon it. Then he broke it and gave a piece of it
to each of the disciples. As he gave it to them, he said:</div>

<p>"Take this, and eat it; this means my body which is
given for you."</p>

<p>Then he took a cup of the wine, and blessed it, and
gave this also to his disciples, saying:</p>

<p>"Drink from this, all of you; this means my blood,
the blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for
many, to take away their sins. I tell you, from this time
I will never again drink the juice of the grape, until that
day when I drink it new with you, in the kingdom of my
Father."</p>

<p>In the old times, an agreement or promise was called
"a covenant," and when it was made a lamb or a goat
was killed for an offering, and laid upon the altar to be
burned. The blood of the offering was poured out on the
altar; and this was called "the blood of the covenant."
Jesus meant to tell his disciples that soon his blood would
be poured forth as the sign of God's promise to take away
sin from those who believed in him.</p>

<p>You have seen at some services in the church a table
covered with a white cloth. When the cloth has been
taken away, you have seen plates of bread and cups of
wine. The minister gives the bread to the people, and
repeats the words of Jesus, "Take, eat; this is my body
which is given for you." And afterward as the wine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
taken, he says, "Drink ye all of this; for this is my blood
shed for you." This service is called "The Lord's
Supper," and it is held to keep in our minds the thought of
the last meal that Jesus ate with his disciples.</p>

<p>"My dear children," said Jesus after the supper,
"I am to be with you only a little longer; then you will
look for me, and as I told the Jews I tell you now, where
I am going you cannot come. I give you a new commandment,
to love one another. As I have loved you, you are
to love each other. By this every one will know that you
are my disciples, by your loving each other."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Simon Peter, "where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going," answered Jesus, "where you cannot
follow me now; but you shall follow me after a time."</p>

<p>"Why cannot I follow you now, Master?" asked
Peter. "I am ready to lay down my life and die for
you!"</p>

<p>"Will you lay down your life for me?" said Jesus.
"I tell you truly, Peter, before the cock crows twice
tomorrow morning you will three times declare that you
have never known me."</p>

<p>But Peter again said most earnestly, "If I must die
with you, I will never deny you."</p>

<p>And all the disciples who were present said with
Peter that they would never forsake their Lord, even unto
death.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Vine and the Branches</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 87</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS SAW that his disciples were greatly disturbed
at his words, as he spoke of going away to some place
where they could not go with him, and leaving them
alone among people who were his enemies; especially
as he told Peter that he would soon disown his Master,
and that all the rest of the disciples should leave him to
suffer alone. Jesus tried to comfort them in their fears
and their sorrows.</div>

<p>"Do not be troubled in your hearts," he said to
them; "trust in God, and trust in me, and in my words.
In my Father's dwelling-place there are many homes. I
am going to prepare a place for you; and when I have
prepared it, I will come back and take you to be with me
there, so that you may be where I am. And you know
the way to the place where I am going."</p>

<p>"Master," said Thomas, "we do not know where you
are going; and how then are we to know the way?"</p>

<p>"I am the way, and the truth, and the life," answered
Jesus. "No one ever comes to the Father in any way
except through me. If you knew me, you would know
my Father also. You know him now, and have seen him;
for you have seen me."</p>

<p>"Master," said Philip, "let us see the Father; that
is all that we want."</p>

<p>"Have I been with you all this time, Philip,"
answered Jesus, "and yet you do not know me? Whoever
has seen me has seen the Father. What do you mean by
saying, 'Let us see the Father'? Do you not believe that
the Father and I are one, that I am in the Father and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Father in me? The words that I speak are my Father's
words; and the works that I do are my Father's works.
I tell you truly, that whoever believes in me shall do the
very works that I do; and he shall do even greater works
than these. I am going to the Father, and whatever you
ask the Father in my name that I will do, that the Father
may be honored in the Son. If you ask anything in my
name, I will do it.</p>

<p>"If you love me," Jesus went on, "you will do whatever
I have told you to do; and I will ask the Father to
give you another Helper to be with you always. That
Helper is the Spirit of Truth. The people of this world
cannot have the Spirit, because they do not see him nor
know him. But you know him, because he is always with
you, and is within you. I will not leave you alone in
your sorrow; I am coming to you. A little while longer,
and the world will see me no more; but you will see me,
for I am living, and you will be living, too. He who has
my commands and keeps them in his heart is the one who
loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my
Father; and I will love him and I will make myself
known to him."</p>

<p>Then said one of the disciples named Judas&mdash;not
Judas Iscariot the traitor (he had gone out), but another
Judas, the brother of James&mdash;"How is it, Lord, that you
are to make yourself known to us and not to the world?"</p>

<p>"If any one loves me," answered Jesus, "he will obey
my word; and my Father will love him; and we will come
to him and make our home with him. He who does not
love me will not obey my words; and the word to which
you are listening is not my own word, but the word of the
Father who sent me. I have told you all this while I am
still with you, but the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the
Father will send to you to take my place, he will teach
you all that you need to know and he will bring to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
mind all that I have said to you. Peace be with you!
My own peace I give you. I do not give my peace to you
as the world gives its 'peace.' Do not let your hearts be
troubled; do not be afraid.</p>

<p>"You heard me say that I was going away and soon
afterward coming
back to you. If you
loved me fully, you
would be glad that I
am going to the
Father, for the
Father is greater
than I am. I have
told you all this&mdash;that
I am going
away&mdash;before it happens,
so that when it
does happen, as it
will very soon, you
may still believe in
me, and believe that
I am coming again."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I am the vine, and you are the branches&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus gave
to his disciples another
parable, "The
Vine and the Branches."
He said:</p>

<p>"I am the true
vine, and my Father is the vine-grower, the Master
of the vineyard. You, my disciples, and all who
believe in me, are the branches of the vine. If the
vine-grower finds on his vine any branches that bear
no fruit, he cuts them off, for they are of no use. If he
finds branches that bear fruit, he trims them and cleans
them, so that they may bear better fruit. You are already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
clean through the word that I have spoken to you. Keep
united to me, the vine, and I will keep united to you.
Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself when separate
from the vine, no more can you bear fruit unless you stay
united to me.</p>

<p>"Remember, I am the vine, and you are the branches.
He who keeps himself in union with me, and keeps me in
union with himself bears rich fruit. But apart from me
you can do nothing. If any one does not stay united to
me, he is thrown away, just as a branch would be, and he
withers up; then the worthless, withered branches are
gathered and thrown into the fire and are burned.</p>

<p>"If you stay united to me, and my teaching stays in
your hearts, you may ask whatever you wish, and it shall
be yours. As you bear rich fruit and prove yourselves
my disciples, my Father is honored. As my Father has
loved me, so I have loved you; stay in my love. If you
keep my commands in your hearts, you will stay in my
love, just as I have kept my Father's commands in my
heart and dwell in his love."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Last Words of Jesus to His
Disciples</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 88</div>


<div class='cap'>JESUS WENT on giving his last talk with his disciples,
in the room after the supper. Among other things,
he said:</div>

<p>"This is my last command to you. Love one another
as I have loved you. No one can give greater proof of
love than by laying down his life for his friends. You
are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not
any more call you 'servants'; for a servant does not know
what his master is doing; but I have called you 'friends,'
for all things that I have learned from my Father I have
told you. It was not you who chose me, but I have chosen
you, and appointed you to go and bear fruit that shall last,
so that the Father may give you whatever you ask in my
name.</p>

<p>"This is what I command you, to love one another.
If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its
own; but because you do not belong to the world, since
I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.
Remember what I said to you, 'A servant is not greater
than his master.' If they have tried to do me harm, they
will try to do you harm too. If they hold to my word, they
will hold to yours also. It is written in the Holy Book,
'They hated me without any cause,' and that word has
come true in me; for they have indeed hated me when
there was no cause for it. But when that Helper comes,
he whom I will send to you&mdash;the Spirit of Truth who comes
from the Father&mdash;he will speak for me; yes, and you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
speak for me, for you have been with me from the very
first.</p>

<p>"I have said these things to you now, so that in the
times to come, knowing these things you will not be
discouraged nor fail. They will put you out of their
churches; yes,
there is coming a
time when if
anyone kills you
he will think that
he is pleasing God.
They will do these
things because
they have not
really known my
Father, nor known
me. But I am
telling you of
these things now,
that when the time
comes, and you
find the rulers
and the people
your enemies, you
will remember I
told you, and will
be ready for these
things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/illus-449.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">In a little while your sorrow shall be turned into
joy, and your joy shall never be taken away
from you</span>
</div>

<p>"I am telling
you the truth; it is
best for you that I go away; for if I do not leave you,
that Helper, the Spirit of God, will not come to you; but
if I go away, I will send him to you. When he the Spirit
of Truth comes, he will lead you into all truth; and he
will make known to you what is to come. In a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
while you will not see me any longer; then after another
little while you will see me again."</p>

<p>These words seemed to the disciples hard to understand.
They said to each other:</p>

<p>"What does he mean by telling us, 'In a little while
you will not see me; then after another little while you
will see me'; and 'I am going to the Father'? What does
he mean by 'a little while'?"</p>

<p>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; and he
said to them, "Are you trying to find out what I meant in
saying 'a little while and ye shall not see me, and then a
little while and ye shall see me'? I tell you truly, that
in a very little while you will be weeping and sorrowing,
while the world around you will be glad. Then in a little
while again, your sorrow shall be turned into joy, for you
shall see me again, and your joy shall never be taken away
from you."</p>

<p>Jesus meant them to understand that in a few hours
he would be taken from them and placed upon the cross
to die; that he would be buried, and all these things
should give them pain and sorrow. But in a few days he
would rise again from the grave, and then they would be
glad and happy, with a happiness that should never pass
away, even though he should again, after that, leave
them and go to the Father.</p>

<p>After saying these things, Jesus lifted up his hands to
God and prayed. In his prayer he gave thanks to God
that he had been able to finish the work that had been
given him to do. He prayed also for his disciples, that
they might all be one in heart, and love each other, and
that they might be kept faithful to the end. He prayed,
too, not only for those his disciples, but for all who
through their words should come to believe in him as the
Saviour of the world; that they all might be of one heart,
loving each other; one with Jesus, and one with his Father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>When Jesus had finished his prayer, they all sang a
hymn together, and went out of the supper room into the
silent streets of the city. They walked toward the Mount
of Olives, as if expecting to return to Bethany, the place
from which they had come in the afternoon.</p>

<p>With the disciples, as they went out of the house, was
a young man whose name was John Mark. He may have
been the son of the man at whose house Jesus and his
disciples had eaten the supper. If that be so, then his
mother's name was Mary, just like the name of Jesus'
mother, though she was not the same woman. Long
afterward, this John Mark wrote one of the four gospels,
telling of the life of Jesus, "The Gospel of Mark."</p>

<h2>In the Garden of Gethsemane</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 89</div>


<div class='cap'>DURING THE week of the Passover, while the
city of Jerusalem held three or four times as
many people as usual, the gates in its walls were
kept open day and night, although during most of the
year they were closed at sunset. It was near midnight
on Thursday when Jesus and his disciples, coming from
the supper room, passed through a gate in the eastern
wall just north of the Temple. They went down into
the valley of the brook Kedron, and crossed the brook
upon a bridge. On the further side of the valley, they
came to an orchard of olive trees, called the Garden
of Gethsemane. Jesus had often visited this garden,
for it was a quiet place; and he loved to pray under
the shadow of its olive trees. The orchard had a
wall around it; and at its gate Jesus said to his
disciples:</div>

<p>"Sit here, while I go and pray inside the garden."</p>

<p>He took with him three of his disciples, Simon
Peter, James, and John his brother, and with these
three went into the garden. The disciples began to
notice that their Master was now showing the signs of
deep sorrow, as if full of grief. He said to the three
disciples:</p>

<p>"My heart is sad; sad even to death; stay here
and watch."</p>

<p>Then he went forward a little way, and fell with
his face upon the earth, and prayed to the Father:</p>

<p>"Oh, my Father! My Father!" he cried. "Thou
canst do anything! Take this cup away from me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
pray! Yet, I do not ask to have my own will, but
only what is thy will."</p>

<p>"The cup" of which Jesus spoke was the terrible
suffering that was very soon to come upon him. In
those last moments, as he saw his trial and death drawing
near like a black cloud, his spirit shrank. So earnest
was his prayer,
that the sweat
stood upon his
face in drops of
blood. Just then
came an angel
from heaven,
standing by his
side to cheer and
help him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illus-454.jpg" width="345" height="400" alt="photo" />
<span class="caption">Ancient olive tree, in the garden of Gethsemane</span>
</div>

<p>He rose up,
and walked to the
place where he
had left the three
disciples. They
had fallen asleep,
being overcome
with the trouble
which they felt in
knowing that
soon they were to lose their Master. Jesus spoke to Peter,</p>

<p>"Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch
with me for a single hour? Watch and pray, all of you,
that you may be kept from being tempted. I know
that your spirit is willing, but your bodies are weak."</p>

<p>Again he went away, and prayed in the same words:</p>

<p>"My Father! My Father! Thou canst do anything!
Take this cup away from me! Yet, I would not
have my own will, but thy will."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming back, he found them again asleep, for their
eyes were heavy and they could not keep them open.
When awaked, they did not know what to say to him,
for they were ashamed of being found asleep a second
time. Jesus left them, and prayed for the third time.
In this prayer he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my Father, if this cup cannot be taken away;
if I must drink it, then thy will be done!"</p>

<p>He went once more to the three disciples, and found
them asleep, just as before. He now said to them:</p>

<p>"You may as well sleep on now, and take your
rest; for it is too late for you to help me. My time
has come! The Son of Man has been given into the
hands of wicked men. Come, get up, here is the traitor
close at hand!"</p>

<p>And at that very instant, while he was speaking
these words, the traitor, Judas Iscariot, burst into the
garden, with a crowd of men, armed with swords and
clubs. These men had been sent by the chief priests
and the rulers to seize Jesus. Spies had been watching
near the house while Jesus was talking after the supper,
and others watching at the gate when Jesus passed
out of it. Word had been sent to the chief priests that
Jesus was in the garden, and while he was praying to
his Father, these men, led by Judas Iscariot, were
hurrying to that place to make Jesus their prisoner.</p>

<p>The men who had come to seize Jesus were not
sure that in the night time, even though the full moon
was shining, they would know him among his disciples.
They said to Judas:</p>

<p>"How can we tell in the dark, under the trees, who
is the one for us to take hold of as prisoner?"</p>

<p>"You watch me," said Judas, "and when I go up
and kiss a man, seize him, for that one whom I shall
kiss will be the man you are looking for."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/illus-456.jpg" width="419" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Judas Iscariot, burst into the garden with a crowd of men, armed
with swords and clubs.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>So Judas went into the garden, where by this time
all the other disciples were gathered around Jesus. He
came rushing up, saying "Master! Master!" and kissed
him, just though he were glad to see him.</p>

<p>"Judas," said Jesus, "do you betray the Son of
Man with a kiss?"</p>

<p>Then he went forward to the band of men who were
standing with their lanterns and torches, their swords
and spears.</p>

<p>"For whom are you looking?" he said to these men.</p>

<p>"For Jesus of Nazareth," they answered him.</p>

<p>"I am he," said Jesus. At the instant when he
said this, they went backward, as if frightened, and
fell upon their faces on the ground. Again, after a
moment, he asked them:</p>

<p>"For whom are you looking?"</p>

<p>And again they answered, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

<p>"I have already told you," said Jesus, "that I
am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men
go away."</p>

<p>For even in that hour Jesus was thinking not of
his own safety, but of his disciples. The delay of a
few moments gave to the disciples some courage. They
began asking:</p>

<p>"Master, shall we strike with the sword?"</p>

<p>Simon Peter, not waiting for an answer from
Jesus, drew a sword which he had brought with him,
and with it struck one of the high priest's servants;
a man named Malchus, and cut off his right ear; for
by this time the band had risen to their feet and were
drawing near. Jesus said:</p>

<p>"Let me at least do this;" and he touched his
ear; and at once his ear was made well again.</p>

<p>"Put up your sword," said Jesus to Peter. "Those
who take the sword shall die by the sword. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
not know, that with a word I could call upon my
Father, and even now he would send me twelve armies
of angels to keep me safely? The cup which my Father
has given me, must I not drink it?"</p>

<p>Then he turned to the band of men who had come
to take him.</p>

<p>"Do you come out to arrest me as if I were a robber,
with swords and clubs? Day after day I was with
you in the Temple, and you did not lay your hands
upon me. But now your time has come, and the dark
Power has its way."</p>

<p>Then the disciples, finding that they could do
nothing to protect Jesus, ran away and left him alone.
The men of the band put chains upon Jesus, and led
him away.</p>

<p>But John followed the company, and Peter also,
anxious to see what would be done with their Lord.
The young man John Mark was also following him,
when one of the band tried to seize hold of him by his
clothes. He left the linen cloth wrapped around him
in the hands of the man, and slipped away with only
his undergarments upon his body.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus Before Annas</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 90</div>


<div class='cap'>THE MEN who took Jesus as their prisoner were
the policemen of the Temple, led by their chief.
With them were some of the priests and officers,
and a crowd of the lowest people, who had been gathered
from the streets by the rulers. All these formed together
a noisy and disorderly mob, dragging Jesus out of the
Garden of Gethsemane and into the city on Mount
Zion. Two of the disciples, Peter and John, followed,
keeping close to the crowd, but outside of it, their
hearts filled with alarm for their Master.</div>

<p>The Temple policemen brought Jesus, all tied with
ropes and chains, to the house on Mount Zion, inside
the wall of the city, where lived one of the chief priests
named Annas. Annas had once been the high priest,
that is, the great priest at the head of all the priests;
but the Roman rulers of the land had taken his office
away from him, and made Caiaphas, whose wife was
the daughter of Annas, high priest in his place. Many
of the people believed that the Romans had no right
to take his office away from Annas, and still looked upon
him as the true and rightful high priest. Annas was a
man of great power, feared by many; and therefore the
men who had seized Jesus brought him first to the house
of Annas. In the house were met a number of the
chief rulers and members of the great council of the Jews.
Jesus was brought in before them all. Annas asked
Jesus to tell him what he had taught, and who were his
disciples. Jesus answered him:</p>

<p>"My teachings have never been in secret; I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
always been open and public in my words. I spoke
everywhere in the churches and in the Temple, where
the people go to worship. Why do you ask me what
I have said? Ask the people who heard me; they know
what I said."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-460.jpg" width="500" height="386" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Priests and officers taking Jesus from the Garden of Gethsemane</span>
</div>

<p>As Jesus spoke these words, one of the police officers
standing by struck Jesus a hard blow with his hand,
saying:</p>

<p>"Is that the way that you answer the high priest?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered him calmly, "If I have said anything
that is not true, prove it; but if I have spoken
the truth, why do you strike me?"</p>

<p>When Jesus was taken into the house of Annas,
John followed the crowd inside, for John knew the
high priest, and he was not afraid to go into his house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
But Peter stood outside in the street. Then John spoke
to the woman who had charge of the door, and asked
her to let in the man standing outside, and she opened
the door for Peter. The rooms of the house stood
around an open court, and Peter stood in the court
among the servants and policemen. It was cold, and
they had made a charcoal fire in a brazier&mdash;that is an
iron pan standing upon either three or four legs. Around
this fire the people gathered; and Peter stood in the
court among them, holding his hands over the fire to
warm them. The woman who kept the door looked
sharply at Peter, and said:</p>

<p>"Are you not one of this man's disciples?"</p>

<p>Peter was alone among the enemies of Jesus, for
John had gone into the room where Jesus was standing
before Annas and the other rulers. Peter felt a sudden
fear come over him, and to this woman's question, he
answered:</p>

<p>"No, I am not!"</p>

<p>Poor Peter! Already he had begun to deny his
Lord!</p>

<p>Annas knew that he had no right to act as judge
upon Jesus. All that he could do was to examine
Jesus, listen to what he might say, and try to find in
his words some ground for his enemies to bring charges
against him. So after a little, Annas sent Jesus, all
bound as he was, to Caiaphas, who was the high priest
by law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

</div><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus Before Caiaphas</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 91</div>


<div class='cap'>THE HIGH PRIEST Caiaphas, before whom Jesus
was now brought for a regular trial, had been
in office many years. He was a shrewd, sharp
man, caring very little about right or wrong, but always
ready to do whatever would please the Jewish leaders,
without giving offence to the Roman rulers.</div>

<p>You remember that after Jesus raised Lazarus to
life, and many people were believing in Jesus, it was
this Caiaphas who said, "No matter whether Jesus is
innocent or guilty, whether he is good or bad, the easiest
way for us to avoid trouble is to kill him; and that we
must do." That showed the spirit of Caiaphas the high
priest.</p>

<p>The houses of Annas and Caiaphas were not far
apart, and may have been in the same group of buildings
on Mount Zion. The officers and policemen took Jesus
into the large hall in the high priest's house where all
the members of the Jewish council that could be brought
together so suddenly were gathered. It was a little
after midnight when Jesus was made prisoner in the
garden, and it must have been between four and five
o'clock on Friday morning when Jesus stood before
Caiaphas and the council.</p>

<p>Peter had come with the crowd, and was in the court
of the high priest's house. John was not there, but
had gone to the house in Jerusalem, where Mary the
mother of Jesus was staying, to bring to her the terrible
news that her Son was in the hands of his enemies,
and to try to give her comfort. So again Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
was left alone in the midst of a throng opposed to
Jesus.</p>

<p>By the law of the Jews, no one could be put to death
unless two persons could be found to tell of a wicked
act that they had seen him do, or wicked words that
they had heard him speak; and also, the accounts of
these two witnesses must agree. The rulers looked for
witnesses to come and speak against Jesus of what
they had seen and heard. They did not care whether
these witnesses speaking against Jesus spoke the truth
or spoke lies; all they wanted was to have them agree
in their words. There were many who spoke falsely
against Jesus, but what they said did not agree. After
a time two men stood up, and said:</p>

<p>"We ourselves heard this man say in the Temple,
'I will destroy this Temple made by the hands of men, and
in three days I will build another made without hands.'"</p>

<p>But even those witnesses did not agree in their
account of what Jesus had said. You remember, that
three years before, in the Temple, Jesus had said,
"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
up." But he was speaking not of the Temple of the
Jews, but of himself as the temple of the Lord, and of
his own death and rising from the tomb. You see how
these men changed the words of Jesus in the telling
of them.</p>

<p>Now, the Jews had agreed that for any man to
speak of destroying the house of God was very wicked;
and that whoever should speak of such a thing must
be put to death. So in the words of these two men,
even though they did not agree, and were false, Caiaphas
and the council saw a chance to carry out their purpose
of putting Jesus to death.</p>

<p>The high priest Caiaphas stood up, and said to
Jesus in a very loud and fierce manner:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you to say of the things spoken by
these witnesses? Have you no answer to give?"</p>

<p>But Jesus stood silent and would not speak a word.
He knew that speaking would not help him, for their
minds were made up to kill him, whatever he might
say. After a moment of waiting Caiaphas spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Are you the Christ," he asked, "the Son of that
Blessed One?"</p>

<p>Then Jesus spoke out, once for all:</p>

<p>"I am," he answered, "and what is more, you will
all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of
Almighty God, and coming in the clouds of heaven!"</p>

<p>At this the high priest became furious. In his
anger he tore his clothes, and flung up his arms and
cried:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>"What awful, awful words!" shouted the high
priest. "Why this man makes himself equal to
Almighty God! We need no more witnesses; he has
spoken his own doom. What shall be done to a man
who calls himself God?"</p>

<p>Then with one voice all the council said, "He
deserves to die," and the sentence of death upon Jesus
was given.</p>

<p>Then they began to spit in his face and to strike
him. They threw a
covering over his face,
and after striking him,
would say, "Are you a
prophet? then tell who it
was that struck you!"</p>

<p>All this time Peter was
in the court of the building,
and through the open
door he could see Jesus
standing in the inner
room. One of the young
women servants looked
closely at Peter, and finally
said:</p>

<p>"You were one of those
with Jesus, the Nazarene!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said
Peter in answer; and he went away from the group
into the hall outside. Just then the cock crew, and
Peter heard it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">

<span class="caption">As Peter was speaking, which was his third denial of his Master, the cock crew
for the second time. At that moment Jesus turned and looked on Peter,
who instantly repented and went out and wept bitter tears.</span>
</div>

<p>Again the woman who had noticed him began to
tell those standing near, "That fellow is one of them!"
But he denied it again. After a little another man said
to Peter:</p>

<p>"You surely are one of this fellow's men! Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
your very accent shows that you come from Galilee!
You speak your words like a Galilean!"</p>

<p>Then Peter began to curse and to swear; and he
said, "I don't know the man you are talking about,
and have never seen him!"</p>

<p>As Peter was speaking, the cock crew for the second
time. And at that moment the Lord Jesus in the inner
room turned and looked on Peter, standing outside the
open door. Then all at once flashed upon Peter's mind
what his Lord had said on the evening before, "Before
the cock crows twice tomorrow morning you will three
times deny that you have ever known me." And Peter
went away, and as he thought upon it all, he was full
of sorrow and wept bitter tears.</p>

<p>But Simon Peter was not the only man in trouble
that morning. There was one whose trouble was far
deeper. That man was Judas Iscariot, who had sold
his Lord for money. When he found that the chief
priests and the council had given sentence of death upon
Jesus, Judas saw how wicked he had been, and that
through his guilty act, Jesus was to be slain. He
brought back to the Temple the thirty pieces of silver
that had been given him, and threw them down upon
the floor, saying:</p>

<p>"I have done wrong in betraying an innocent man!
Take back your money!"</p>

<p>"What difference is that to us?" answered the
priests. "That is your affair, not ours."</p>

<p>Judas went away, and in his sorrow became wild
and hung himself. The next day he was found hanging
dead. The chief priests did not know what to do with
the money that he had brought back. They said:</p>

<p>"It would never do to put that money among the
gifts of the people to the Temple, for it is the price of
blood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>They finally decided to take the money; and with
it bought a piece of ground as a burial-place for strangers
in the city. They bought it of a man who made pots
and jars of earthenware; and it was named "The Potter's
Field." But by all the people it was called ever
after "The Field of Blood."</p>

<h2>Jesus Before the Roman Governor</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 92</div>


<div class='cap'>ALTHOUGH the high council of the Jews had given
sentence upon Jesus that he should be put to death,
they could not kill him without the consent of the
Roman governor, Pontius Pilate; for long before this
the Romans had taken away from the Jews the right to
put any man to death. So, very early in the morning,
before sunrise, the chief priests and rulers brought Jesus
to the castle where the governor was staying. His home
was in the city of Cæsarea, nearly sixty miles away, on
the sea-coast; but at the time of the Passover, when the
city was crowded with people from every part of the
land, he usually came to Jerusalem to see that it was kept
quiet and in order; and at this time he stayed in a castle
north of the Temple, called "The Castle of Antonia."</div>

<p>The Jews had condemned Jesus to die, because, as
they claimed, he had said that he was the Son of God;
and that claim according to their laws was a high crime,
deserving of death. Jesus <i>was</i> the Son of God, and as
God's Son they should have honored him and obeyed his
teachings. But they knew very well that Pilate would
not care for their law, and would not order Jesus put to
death merely because Jesus had said that he was the
Son of God. So they undertook to find something
against Jesus which was contrary to the laws of the
Romans; and the charge which they resolved to make
was that Jesus had spoken against the Roman rule, and
had declared that he himself was the King of the Jews.
He was, indeed, a king, but not such a king as would
be against the Romans or their government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jews came to the castle, and standing outside,
called for Pilate to come from the room where he was
sleeping, and give judgment upon a law-breaker whom
they had brought to him. They hoped that Pilate would
do as they wished, without looking closely into the
matter. He came down, and sat upon his throne as a
judge, and said:</p>

<p>"What is the charge which you bring against this
man?"</p>

<p>"If he were not a wicked man, one who has broken
the laws, we would not have brought him to you," they
answered.</p>

<p>"Well," said Pilate, "if he has broken the laws of
the land, take him to your own court and punish him."</p>

<p>"We found this man," said the Jewish rulers,
"everywhere leading the people away from their rulers.
He forbids them to pay the tax to the Roman emperor,
Cæsar, telling the people that he is Christ, the King of
the Jews. He ought to be put to death for stirring the
people up against the government, and we ask you to
give sentence against him."</p>

<p>Pilate began at once to be very suspicious of these
Jewish rulers. He knew that they themselves hated the
Roman power, and that they would never wish to have
anybody punished for opposing it. He looked at Jesus,
standing bound and helpless among them, and he thought
that this man could not be a dangerous enemy. Pilate
said to them:</p>

<p>"Bring this man to me. I wish to speak with him."</p>

<p>Jesus was led up to the foot of the steps to Pilate's
judgment throne; and Pilate asked him,</p>

<p>"Are you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered the governor, "Do you ask this of
your own accord, or did others tell you that I am a king?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus-473.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus was led to Pilate, who questioned him privately: &quot;Are you the
King of the Jews?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Do you take me for a Jew?" asked Pilate. "Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
own people and the priests have brought you before me,
saying that you have claimed to be a king. Now tell
me, what have you done?"</p>

<p>"My rule as a king does not belong to this world,"
said Jesus. "If my kingdom were of this world, my men
would fight to keep me from being given up to the Jews;
but my kingdom is not here on the earth."</p>

<p>"Then you are a king!" said Pilate.</p>

<p>"You speak the truth, I am a king," said Jesus.
"I was born for this: I came into the world for this, that
I should speak in behalf of the truth. Every one who is
on the side of truth listens to my words."</p>

<p>"Truth! What is truth?" said Pilate. Then he
went out of the hall and spoke to the Jewish rulers:</p>

<p>"I do not find anything wrong in this man."</p>

<p>This decision of Pilate made the Jews very angry,
for they had hoped that he would approve their sentence
without asking many questions; and now they found
that he was willing to set Jesus free. Pilate thought
that Jesus was a harmless man, perhaps not quite right
in his mind in believing that he was a king.</p>

<p>But the rulers would not cease their charges against
Jesus. They said to Pilate, "This man stirs up the
people everywhere, and makes trouble. He began in
Galilee; and now he has come here."</p>

<p>"What," said Pilate, "does this man come from
Galilee? Then he belongs to the rule of King Herod;
and Herod is now here in Jerusalem. Take him to
Herod, and let Herod decide his case."</p>

<p>This Pilate said merely because he wished to avoid
deciding it himself. He knew that Jesus had broken no
law, and should be set free; but he did not wish to displease
the Jewish rulers, and he thought to rid himself
of the matter by sending Jesus to be tried before Herod,
the ruler of Galilee.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>



<h2>Jesus Before Herod</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 93</div>


<div class='cap'>HEROD, to whom Jesus had been sent by Pilate,
was the ruler of Galilee, the northern part of the
land, and of Perea, on the east of the river Jordan.
Jesus had lived in Galilee nearly all his life; and lately
had been through Perea, preaching, so that Herod had
been the ruler over Jesus for years. Herod was not
really a king. His title was "Tetrarch," which means,
"the ruler of a fourth part of a kingdom"; and he was so
called because when his father, Herod the Great, died,
he received as his share one-fourth of his father's kingdom.
But he was generally called "King Herod,"
because the people knew that it pleased him to be looked
upon as a king, rather than "the quarter of a king."
This was the Herod who had caused John the Baptist
to be killed, on account of his promise to the young
girl who danced at his feast. That shows what sort of
a man Herod was&mdash;weak of will, fond of pleasure, and
caring very little whether his acts were right or wrong.</div>

<p>Like thousands of other people, high and low, King
Herod had come to Jerusalem to take part in the Feast
of the Passover; for Herod was a Jew, and kept the
Jewish feasts; while Pontius Pilate, the governor of
Judea, was a Roman, and worshipped the idols of Rome.
Herod was highly pleased to have Jesus sent to him for
trial, partly because Pilate and Herod, rulers of lands
next to each other, had not been friendly, and this act,
the sending of Jesus for trial, showed that Pilate wished
to have Herod as his friend. Also, while Jesus was
living in Capernaum and teaching all through Galilee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
Herod had heard much about him. You remember that
some time before this, when they told King Herod of the
many wonderful works of Jesus, how he made the sick
well, gave sight to the blind, and even raised the dead,
Herod said, "This must be John the Baptist whom I
killed, come to life again."</p>

<p>Although Herod did not live in Jerusalem, but in
Galilee, he owned a fine house in that city, called a
palace; and in this palace he stayed while in Jerusalem.
Into the great hall of this palace Jesus was brought by
the soldiers of Pilate; and the high priest Caiaphas
came with them, also many of the Jewish priests and
rulers, to speak against Jesus. Herod was very glad to
see Jesus, the prophet and wonder-worker of whom he
had heard so much. He wished to see Jesus work a
miracle, and commanded him to do it, for he supposed
that Jesus, being in his power, for life or death, would be
very desirous of pleasing him.</p>

<p>But as you know, Jesus never worked his miracles
merely for people to look at them. He would make
the sick people well or give hearing to the deaf, because
he pitied them in their trouble; but when Herod spoke
to him, calling upon him to do some wonderful work,
Jesus stood still, and would do nothing. Herod asked
Jesus many questions, but Jesus would not answer them,
and remained silent. The king did not know what to do
with such a prisoner, who would not speak a word, even
to save his life.</p>

<p>All this time, while Jesus was silent, the priests and
the rulers stood around him, charging Jesus with wickedness
of all sorts, disobedience to the laws of the land, and
trying to make himself a king in Herod's own country.
But Jesus answered nothing to all their charges against
him.</p>

<p>Herod thought to make sport of Jesus. As they said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
falsely that Jesus claimed to be "King of the Jews,"
Herod sent for a splendid mantle, such as kings wore,
and had it placed on Jesus. Then they bowed low
before him, and called him "king," mocking him as one
who pretended to royal power. But in the midst of the
crowd of mockers stood Jesus, calm and still, paying no
attention and looking as though his thoughts were
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Herod knew very well that Jesus had done nothing
worthy of death; that he was a good man, and harmless.
He would not do what the priests and rulers urged him,
over and over again, to do, to command that Jesus
should be put to death. So, after holding Jesus up to
contempt for some time, he sent him back to Pilate, all
dressed as Jesus was in the royal robe.</p>

<h2>Jesus Sentenced to Death</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 94</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN PILATE sent Jesus to King Herod, he felt
relieved, for he was unwilling on one hand to
order Jesus, an innocent man, to be put to
death; and on the other hand, he did not wish to offend
the Jewish rulers by setting Jesus free. He thought
that he had gotten rid of his difficulties, when suddenly
he found Jesus brought back to him, and the
priests clamoring as before, that he should be put to
death.</div>

<p>Pilate very unwillingly sat down again upon his
throne, compelled to hold the trial of Jesus once more,
and unable to avoid making a decision upon his case.
Just as he was about to begin the new trial of Jesus, a
message from his wife came to him, which added to his
anxiety and his alarm. Pilate's wife sent this word
to him:</p>

<p>"My husband, I ask you not to allow any harm to
come to that good man; for this day I have been very
unhappy on account of a dream about him."</p>

<p>This message made Pilate all the more desirous not
to yield to the Jews and put Jesus to death. He thought
of a new plan to save the life of Jesus; and with this in
mind he said to the chief priests and the leaders:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/illus-480.jpg" width="410" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The soldiers took Jesus into the guard room, tied him to a pillar, and beat him
with heavy whips.</span>
</div>

<p>"You brought before me this man charged with the
crime of trying to lead the people to rise up against the
government, and I have looked into his case, and have
found the charges false. He has not done the things
that you accuse him of; and there is nothing wicked in
his acts, so far as I can see. Nor has Herod found any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
fault with him, for he has sent him back. He has done
nothing that demands death. But he deserves some
punishment for causing all this excitement and stir.
I will order him to be well beaten, and then set free."</p>

<p>But with one voice, they all cried out, "Away with
this fellow! To the cross with him! Don't release him:
release to us Barabbas!"</p>

<p>It was a custom that at the Feast of the Passover,
as a sign of the gladness of the time, to set free some
prisoner, whatever man in prison the people should call
for. There was at that time in the prison a man named
Barabbas, who had led a party of Jews against the
Roman rulers, and in the fight had killed a man. He
had been condemned to die, but the people did not
think any the less of him because he had fought against
the Romans, whom they also hated, and whom they
would gladly drive out of the land if they were not afraid
of their power. The crowd began calling out to Pilate to
do as had been done every year, and set free some prisoner.</p>

<p>"Are you willing," asked Pilate "that I should free
this man Jesus, the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>But the chief priests and the Jewish rulers went
around among the crowd, and persuaded them to ask,
not for Jesus, but for Barabbas. And the people shouted
out, as if they were all one man:</p>

<p>"We will not have this man; we will have
Barabbas!"</p>

<p>This was not what Pilate had looked for. He had
thought that according to the custom of the feast he
might set Jesus free and still please the people. He
said to the crowd:</p>

<p>"What then shall I do with Jesus, the man whom
they call Christ?"</p>

<p>"Send him to the cross! Let him die on the cross!"
they roared with all their might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/illus-482.jpg" width="405" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">They put on Jesus a cloak of scarlet and wove together a wreath of thorns and
pressed it on his head until the blood streamed out; they beat him with
the reed, and in mockery bowed before him saying: &quot;Long live the King of
the Jews.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what wicked thing has he done?" asked
Pilate of the crowd. "I find nothing on his part that
deserves death. I will have him beaten, and let
him go!"</p>

<p>Then, at Pilate's command, the soldiers took Jesus
into the guard room. They stripped off all his clothes,
tied him to one of the pillars, and beat him with heavy
whips, which tore into his flesh. To mock him, as one
who called himself "King," they put on him a cloak of
scarlet color; they wove together a wreath of thorns,
and pressed it on his head until the blood streamed out;
they placed in his hand a reed, as if it were a scepter
held by a king; they fell down on their knees before him,
and said to him: "Long live the King of the Jews!"
They struck him with their hands, over and over again;
they beat him with the reed; and they spat in his face.</p>

<p>Pilate thought that if the people could see Jesus as
he was, crowned with thorns, and covered with blood,
they would feel pity for him, and not call for him to be
put to death. He said to the Jews:</p>

<p>"I will bring him out for you to see; but understand,
I cannot find anything wrong in him."</p>

<p>Then they brought Jesus out on the steps of the
palace. His face was stained with blood; on his head
was the wreath of thorns; and on his shoulders was the
scarlet cloak. And Pilate said to the crowd:</p>

<p>"See, here is the man!"</p>

<p>But if Pilate hoped that the sight of Jesus, so woeful
and sad, would arouse the pity of the people, he soon
found himself mistaken. Led by the chief priests and
their officers, they cried out with loud voices:</p>

<p>"To the cross with him! Let him be crucified!"</p>

<p>To be crucified was to be fastened with nails on a
cross, which was then stood up, and left standing until
the suffering man was dead. This was what the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
of Jews before Pilate's palace called upon him to do
with Jesus who had done no harm, but only good!</p>

<p>Pilate answered them: "You can take him and
crucify him, if you choose. I will have nothing to do
with it; for I can not find that he has done anything
wicked."</p>

<p>The rulers of the Jews answered Pilate: "But we
have a law; and by our law he must die, because he
has made himself out to be the Son of God!"</p>

<p>When Pilate heard that, he was still more afraid,
for there seemed to him something strange in this man
Jesus. He did not know what to do. He went inside
the palace and took Jesus with him.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" said Pilate to Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate said to him:</p>

<p>"You will not speak to me? Don't you know that
it is in my power either to set you free, or to send you to
the cross, just as I please?"</p>

<p>"You would have no power over me," answered
Jesus, "if it had not been given you from one who is
above. God gave you that power to use for the right
and not for the wrong. There is one man whose sin is
greater than yours; and that is the high priest who
brought me to you!" Jesus meant to have Pilate
understand that he was only a weak man, yielding to the
will of the high priest, and that he as the governor
should have a mind of his own and do only what was
right in God's sight.</p>

<p>All this made Pilate the more anxious not to put
Jesus to death, but to set him free. But the rulers of the
Jews shouted aloud to him:</p>

<p>"If you set this man free, who has called himself a
king, you are no friend to Cæsar, the emperor at Rome!
Anyone who calls himself a king sets himself above the
emperor who is over us all!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus-485.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Pilate washed his hands, and holding them out, called to the people: &quot;My
hands are clean from this good man&#39;s blood! This is your
doing, not mine!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilate knew that Cæsar the emperor was very
jealous and would be very angry if he knew that any man
was trying to make himself a king. Very unwillingly,
Pilate made up his mind that it would be safer for himself
to let Jesus be put to death, rather than to make the
emperor at Rome his enemy. So Pilate again took his
seat upon the throne, and had Jesus brought before him.
It was now the time of sunrise, six o'clock in the morning.
Pilate said to the Jews:</p>

<p>"Here is your king!"</p>

<p>"Kill him! kill him!" yelled the Jews. "Crucify
him! Crucify him!"</p>

<p>"This fellow is not our king," shouted the priests
and rulers. "We have no king but Cæsar the emperor!"</p>

<p>Pilate tried to show the Jews that the act of putting
Jesus to death was their deed, not his. He sent for a
basin of water, and in presence of them all washed his
hands. Then holding out his hands, he called out to
the people:</p>

<p>"My hands are clean from this good man's blood!
I tell you that he has done nothing to deserve death!
This is your doing, not mine!"</p>

<p>"This blood be on us, and on our children who come
after us," answered the Jews.</p>

<p>Then Pilate, sitting on his throne, gave sentence that
it should be as they wished, that Barabbas, a robber and
a murderer, should be set free, and that Jesus, who had
done no harm, but only good, should be sent to the cross.</p>

food is given him to eat, and he is allowed to live his last
days in peace. But in the old times, when Jesus was
among men, prisoners appointed to die were treated with
the greatest cruelty. They were mocked and beaten and
spit upon for an hour or more, and then they were led
away to death.</div>

<p>So it was with Jesus on that day. After the soldiers
had treated him shamefully, they took off the scarlet robe
and put on him his own clothes. Then they laid upon his
wounded shoulders the heavy beam of his cross, and led
him from Pilate's palace through the streets of Jerusalem
toward a hill outside the city wall. This hill was called
in the Hebrew tongue, the language of the Jewish people,
"Golgotha," a word meaning "Skull-place." In the
language of the Romans, the word meaning "Skull-place"
was "Calvaria," and from this word the place where
Jesus was crucified has been called "Mount Calvary."</p>

<p>It is not certain where was the true Mount Calvary,
the place of Christ's cross. For a long time it was believed
to be a little hill on the west of the city; and over that hill
was built in the after years a great church, called "The
Church of the Holy Sepulchre," because inside that church
they show not only the place where people thought that
the cross stood, but also the tomb or sepulchre in which
Jesus was buried. To this church thousands of people go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
every year, thinking that they can see the very places
where the Saviour died and was buried.</p>

<p>But most of those who have studied carefully all
that can be known about the city of Jerusalem and the
hills around it, have believed that the true Calvary was
not where the great Church of the Holy Sepulchre now
stands, but at
some other place.
Many think that
it was a rounded,
grass-covered little
hill just outside
the city on the
north. The side
of this hill looking
toward the city is
very steep, and in
it are two great
caves. As one
stands on the city
wall and looks at
this rounded hill,
with the two holes
in it, he thinks of
a skull&mdash;which is
a man's head
without the skin
and the flesh, and with two eye-holes. This hill may
have been called "the skull-place," because it looks so
much like a skull. On this skull-like hill it may be that
Jesus was crucified.</p>

<span class="caption">Turning to the women weeping over him, Jesus said: &quot;Women of Jerusalem,
weep not for me but weep for yourselves and your children!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Jesus walked through the streets of the city loaded
down with the heavy beam of his cross on his shoulders.
The soldiers were dragging him on, and some were driving
him forward with blows, when suddenly, worn out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
suffering, and fainting from loss of blood and want of food,
he sank down upon the ground, unable to carry his load
any further. Just then a man coming from the country
into Jerusalem, met the soldiers and the crowd with
Jesus. This man was named Simon. He was not Simon
Peter, the disciple of Jesus, but another Simon, who had
come from a city far away in Africa, called Cyrene. The
soldiers seized this man, and made him help Jesus in
carrying the cross, until they came to Calvary.</p>

<p>Following the soldiers who had been commanded to
crucify Jesus, was a crowd of Jewish priests and scribes,
the teachers of the law, and a multitude of the lowest of
the people, all shouting aloud their rejoicing that Jesus
was to be put to death, just as if he had been the wickedest
man in all the land. But among these were a few friends
of Jesus, and some of the women who had known him
and loved him, and were now weeping over the wrongs
done to him.</p>

<p>Jesus turned and spoke to these women:</p>

<p>"Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep
for yourselves and your children! For the time is coming
when they shall say, 'Happy are those who have no
children to suffer and to die.' In those days they shall
call out to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills,
'Hide us.' If this is what they do now in the beginning,
what will they do then in the end?"</p>

<p>Even in those terrible moments Jesus was not thinking
of himself and his own sufferings, but the sorrows that
would soon come upon others.</p>

<span class="caption">ANCIENT JERUSALEM</span>
</div>

<p>There is a story told of Jesus on the way to Calvary,
which is not found in any of the gospels, and may not be
true. It is said that a good woman, named Veronica,
was standing by the street when Jesus went by. Seeing
his face covered with sweat, and dust, and blood, she
went to him and wiped his face with a napkin. When she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
looked at her napkin, she found that on it had been printed
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'portr  t'">portrait</ins> of Jesus; and she kept it ever afterward as her
greatest treasure.</p>

<p>They led Jesus out of the gate in the city wall, and up
the side of the hill Calvary, wherever that hill was. There
they laid the cross upon the ground and stretched Jesus
out upon it. They drove nails through his hands and
feet to fasten his body to the cross. Then they lifted it
up with Jesus upon it, and dropped the lower end of it
into a hole so that it would stand upright.</p>

<p>With Jesus they had brought two other men, who
had been robbers, and sentenced to die by the cross.
These two men they crucified with Jesus, one on his right
hand and the other on his left, and Jesus between them,
as if he had been the most wicked man of the three.</p>

<p>Jesus knew that the Roman soldiers who fastened
him to the cross were not his enemies, as the Jews were,
but were only obeying the orders that had been given
them by their officers. He prayed to God for them.</p>

<p>"Father," said Jesus, "forgive them, for they do not
know what they are doing!"</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock on Friday morning when Jesus
was placed upon the cross; and he hung there living for
six awful hours, until three o'clock in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<h2>Jesus on the Cross</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 96</div>


<div class='cap'>IT WAS the custom of the Romans when they put to
death any man upon the cross, to place on the cross
above his head a writing, telling what the man's
crime was. Pilate commanded that the writing above the
head of Jesus should be</div>

<div class='center'>
THIS IS JESUS OF NAZARETH<br />
THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br />
</div>

<p>It was written in the language of three different
peoples; in Hebrew, the tongue spoken by the Jews; in
Latin, the language of the Romans; and in Greek, the
language spoken by all in that part of the world who were
not Jews. These words told a great truth, that Jesus
was a king, and they told it to all the earth, although very
few people believed it then. Now, all over the world are
millions upon millions of people who serve Jesus as
Lord and King.</p>

<p>When the priests and rulers of the Jews read this
writing upon the cross they were greatly displeased, for
they did not like to have Jesus called a king. The priests
went to Pilate in his palace and said to him:</p>

<p>"Will you not change the writing upon the cross of
that man? Let it not be, 'The King of the Jews.' Please
change it to, 'He said, "I am King of the Jews."'"</p>

<p>But Pilate answered them, "What I have written,
I have written." He meant that whatever he had placed
upon the cross must stand there unchanged.</p>

<p>It was also the custom of the Romans when a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
was crucified to give his clothes to the soldiers who fixed
him on the cross. Four soldiers were in charge of the
cross. These men divided the clothes of Jesus among
them, each taking one garment. But one garment was
left over, the shirt of Jesus. This was all woven in one
piece, not sewed together; so the soldiers said:</p>

<p>"Let us not tear it, but cast lots to settle whose it
shall be."</p>

<p>They threw upon the ground little square pieces of
ivory having spots upon them. These squares were called
dice. Each soldier threw one ivory piece; and they
counted the spots on the side that was uppermost. The
soldier whose piece showed the highest number took the
shirt of Jesus as his own. One of the disciples of Jesus
was standing near, and saw the soldiers dividing the
clothes of Jesus, and he thought of the words in the
twenty-second psalm, as a prophecy or foretelling of what
should happen to Christ. These were the words of the
psalm, written many hundred years before:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"They shared my garments among them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And over my clothing they cast lots."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The soldiers having done their work, sat down around
the cross to watch it. A great crowd of the priests and
scribes and people stood around the cross, looking at
Jesus hanging there. Some of them spoke spitefully to
Jesus, shaking their heads at him, saying such words as
these:</p>

<p>"Ah! you would destroy the Temple and build it
again in three days, would you? Then come down from
the cross and save yourself if you can!"</p>

<p>And some of the priests and scribes called out, "He
saved others; but he can not save himself! If he is, as
he said, 'Christ, the King of Israel,' let him now come down
from the cross in our sight. Then we will believe on him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>"He trusts in God," said others; "now let God help
him, if he chooses; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"</p>

<p>One of the two robbers who were hanging on the
crosses beside Jesus called out to him, joining in the abuse:</p>

<p>"Are you not the Christ, the King of Israel? If you
are, why don't you save yourself and save us with you?"</p>

<p>But the crucified man on the other side of Jesus
rebuked him:</p>

<p>"Have you no fear of a just God?" he said. "You
are suffering the same sentence as this man. And you
and I are suffering only what we deserve for our deeds;
but this man has done nothing wrong."</p>

<p>Then this man from his cross said to Jesus, "Jesus,
do not forget me when you come into your kingdom."</p>

<p>And Jesus answered him, "I tell you truly, this very
day you shall be with me in the heavenly land."</p>

<p>At this time, near the cross of Jesus, was standing
John, his disciple, the one disciple that Jesus loved, and
with him was Mary, the mother of Jesus, also her sister
and two other women named Mary&mdash;Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene, or Mary of Magdala.
When Jesus saw his mother, and beside her the disciple
whom he loved, he spoke from the cross to her:</p>

<p>"Woman, there is your son."</p>

<p>Then he said to John:</p>

<p>"Son, there is your mother."</p>

<p>And from that time Mary, the mother of Jesus, lived
with the disciple John, as though he was her own son.</p>

<p>It was now noon, and Jesus had been upon the cross
three long, terrible hours; the sun beating with its rays
upon his head. Just at noon a sudden darkness came
over the sky and the earth, and the darkness did not pass
away until three o'clock. This darkness alarmed the
people, and those who had been speaking to Jesus words
of contempt, now stood still, full of fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>At about three o'clock, Jesus called out with a loud
voice these words:</p>

<p>"My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>These are the opening words of the twenty-second
psalm, written many hundred years before as a prophecy
of what Christ should suffer. It may be that Jesus
spoke those words to show that all his suffering had
been foretold long before. Jesus in speaking those
words used the old Hebrew tongue, the language in
which the psalm was written. In the old Hebrew the
words, "My God! My God!" were "Eloi! Eloi!"
But the language had changed so greatly since the
psalms were written that the people who heard him
did not understand the words. Some said, "He is calling
upon Elijah the prophet to help him!"</p>

<p>Then Jesus spoke again and said:</p>

<p>"I am thirsty."</p>

<p>There was standing by a jar full of vinegar. One of the
men took a sponge, soaked it in the vinegar, fastened it on
the end of a stick, and placed it on the lips of Jesus. This also
had been foretold in the sixty-ninth psalm, in the words,</p>

<div class='center'>
"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."<br />
</div>

<p>As soon as Jesus tasted the vinegar, he said:</p>

<p>"All is finished."</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's pause, he spoke with a
loud voice to God:</p>

<p>"Father, into thy hands I give up my spirit!"</p>

<p>And with those words his head dropped forward,
and Jesus was hanging dead upon his cross.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

<span class="caption">The people on Mt. Calvary looking at the dying Jesus were filled with fear, and
went back to the city in terror at the darkness and earthquake.</span>
</div>

<p>Just at the moment when Jesus died, suddenly
there was an earthquake; the ground was shaken, the
rocks were torn apart, and many of the tombs around
Jerusalem were opened. In the Temple on Mount
Moriah, a wonderful event was seen. The great veil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
that hung between the Holy Place and the Most Holy
Place was suddenly torn from the top to the bottom,
as if by a mighty unseen hand, so that the priests in the
Temple could see what none of them, except the high priest,
had ever seen before, the inside of the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>The people who were standing on Mount Calvary,
looking at the dying Jesus, were filled with fear. They
beat upon their breasts with their hands, and went
back to the city in terror at the darkness and the earthquake.
The Roman captain, who was in charge of the
soldiers around the cross, said:</p>

<p>"Surely this was a good man, a son of God!"</p>

<p>You know that the Sabbath among the Jews was
kept on the seventh day of the week and that it always
began at sunset on the evening before. It was on
Friday that Jesus was crucified, and three o'clock on
that afternoon. The Jews did not wish to have the
men upon the three crosses hanging there upon the
Sabbath, for that day, the Passover Sabbath, was kept
especially holy.</p>

<p>The Jewish rulers came to Pilate and asked him
that the men should not be left upon the cross over
the Sabbath, but that they should be killed and their
bodies taken away. They did not know at that time
that Jesus was already dead. Pilate gave orders to
the soldiers to have the men killed. This they did by
breaking their legs, as they hung upon the crosses.
As they saw that Jesus was no longer alive, they did
not break his legs. But one of the soldiers, to be sure
of his death, drove his spear into the side of Jesus, to
strike his heart. John the disciple was still standing
there watching beside the cross to the very last, and
he wrote in his gospel many years afterward that he
saw both water and blood pour forth from the side of
Jesus, out of the wound made by the spear.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Tomb in the Garden</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 97</div>


<div class='cap'>YOU REMEMBER that from the garden of Gethsemane,
very early on Friday morning, Jesus was
brought before the high council of the Jews for
trial, and that by the council it was ordered that Jesus
should be put to death as one who falsely claimed that
he was Christ, the King of Israel. But not all the members
of this council were enemies of Jesus. A very few of them
were his friends, but in secret, not daring to speak for him
or to vote for him, for fear of the rulers and the people.</div>

<p>One of these secret friends of Jesus was Nicodemus,
the ruler who had come to see Jesus at night three years
before, on his first visit to Jerusalem. Another was a
good man named Joseph, a rich man, who lived at a
place called Arimathea, some miles out of Jerusalem, in
the country. This man, Joseph of Arimathea, did a very
bold thing. He went to Pilate in his palace, and asked
Pilate to allow him to take down from the cross the dead
body of Jesus, and to bury it. To us this may not
seem a brave act, but it was, for the Roman rulers were
very suspicious of anybody who appeared to be the
friend of one who had been condemned to death. Some
time before this, when a man asked the governor for the
body of a man who had been put to death, the governor
ordered that his friend should also be slain as an enemy
of the Romans and the governor's enemy. It might be
said that Joseph of Arimathea "took his life in his
hands" when he asked Pilate for the body of Jesus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/illus-502.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">In the side of a rocky hill was a cave which Joseph of Arimathea had hollowed
out for his own tomb, and there they laid the body of Jesus.</span>
</div>

<p>But Pilate was not angry with Joseph; and at
heart he was not an enemy of Jesus. Pilate was surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
to learn that Jesus was already dead, for sometimes
upon the cross men lived several days of terrible pain.
He sent for the Roman captain who had been in charge
at the cross, and asked him if Jesus the Nazarene was
dead. When the captain told him that Jesus was dead,
he allowed Joseph to take away the body and do with
it as he pleased.</p>

<p>Then Joseph, with some of the disciples of Jesus,
carefully and tenderly took down from the cross the
body of Jesus; and after the manner of Jewish burials
at that time, wrapped it round and round with long
strips of linen cloth. They also tied a napkin over the
face of Jesus. Nicodemus came to help in the burial,
bringing with him the weight of a hundred pounds in
fragrant and costly spices, aloes and myrrh, which they
laid in the linen cloth around the body.</p>

<p>Near the place where Jesus was crucified was a
garden belonging to Joseph of Arimathea, and in the
side of the rocky hill was a cave which Joseph had hollowed
out for his own tomb. No dead body had ever
been buried in this tomb; and there they laid the body
of Jesus. Then they rolled a great stone to the door
of the tomb, and left it.</p>

<p>Near by, at this time, were some of the women who
had come with Jesus from Galilee; looking on while
the body of Jesus, whom they had loved so fondly, was
laid in the tomb. One of these women was Mary
Magdalene, or "Mary of Magdala" by the Sea of Galilee,
a woman from whom Jesus had driven out evil spirits
more than a year before. Another woman was Mary,
the wife of Clopas; and another was named Salome,
who may have been the mother of the disciples James
and John, and the wife of Zebedee the fisherman. These
women noticed carefully the place where the body of
Jesus was buried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>On the next morning, which was the Jewish Sabbath
day, the chief priests and leading men among the
Jews came to Pilate and said to him:</p>

<p>"We remember, sir, that while this man who
deceived the people was alive, he said, 'After three days
in the tomb I will arise again.' Now, then, give orders
that the tomb where he is buried be kept under guard
for three days. For if it be not watched, his disciples
may come and steal his body out of the tomb and
hide it; then they will tell the people, 'He is risen from
the dead,' and the last false report will do more harm
than the first, that he was the King of Israel."</p>

<p>"Take a guard of soldiers," said Pilate, "and make
it just as sure as you can."</p>

<p>So they went and made the tomb secure by putting
a seal on the great stone at the door. Also they placed
a guard of soldiers in front of the tomb, with orders
to stay there for three days.</p>

<p>On one side of the rounded skull-like hill which may
have been Calvary, where Jesus was crucified, there
has been found a very ancient tomb, which may have
been the place of the Saviour's burial. No one can be
sure of this; but we may be certain that either in this
tomb, or in one like it, not far away, Jesus was buried.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Risen Christ and the Empty Tomb</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 98</div>


<div class='cap'>IT WAS FRIDAY evening at sunset, only three hours
after Jesus had died upon his cross, when the stone
at the door of the tomb was rolled against the door,
and the body of Jesus was left alone in its resting place.
All day on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, and through
that night, the body lay in the tomb, watched by Roman
soldiers. But early on Sunday morning, before the sun
rose, something wonderful took place such as had never
been seen from the beginning of the world and never
has been seen since that day.</div>

<p>There was a great earthquake, shaking the ground
around the tomb, as an angel from heaven came down.
His face and his form shone with dazzling brightness
like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow glittering
in the sun. The soldiers on guard trembled as
they saw the angel, and fell down on the ground as if
they were dead; and after a little while rising up, crept
away in their fear, and left the garden.</p>

<p>The bright angel laid his hand on the stone at the
door of the tomb, paying no attention to the seal upon
it, and rolled the stone away. As he stood at the open
door of the tomb, the Lord Jesus Christ walked out from
it, no longer dead but living, and living never to die
again. The grave clothes were not now wrapped around
his body, and the napkin had been taken from his face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/illus-506.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">The women at the empty tomb listened in fear and wonder to the words of the
angel: &quot;He is not here; he has risen!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>If the Roman soldiers were still there, they could not
see Jesus, for a change had come over him, and he was
now seen only by those whom he wished to see him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
by no others. And he could suddenly appear and disappear
as he chose. He could be seen suddenly in one
place, and then a moment after could be seen just as
suddenly in another place miles and miles away. He
could pass through closed doors just as if they were
wide open; and after being seen by his friends could
vanish out of their sight.</p>

<p>A few moments after the earthquake, and after the
risen Christ had come from his tomb, a few women
came from the city to the tomb, bringing some more
spices and perfumes to place around his body. Those
women were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Salome, and a woman named Joanna, and
perhaps others. They may have felt the earthquake
shock, but they did not know the wonderful things that
had taken place, and supposed that the body of Jesus
was in the tomb. As they came near, they said to
each other:</p>

<p>"Who will roll away for us the great stone at the
door of the tomb?"</p>

<p>But when they came to the tomb, they found the
stone already rolled away, and the tomb open. Mary
Magdalene came a little before the others, and was the
first to see that the tomb was open, and looking inside
she saw that it was empty. She took but one glance,
and then, without waiting for the others, ran away to
tell some of the disciples of Jesus that the tomb had
been opened and the body of Jesus taken away, for she
did not know that Jesus had risen and was living.</p>

<p>A moment after Mary Magdalene had gone away,
the other women came to the tomb. They, too, saw
that the stone had been rolled away, the tomb was
open and the body of Jesus was not there. But these
women saw what Mary Magdalene had not seen, a
young man with shining face and long white robe, seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
on the right side of the place where the body of Jesus
had been laid. They were frightened as they looked
upon him, for this young man was the angel who had
rolled away the stone. But he calmed their fears, saying
to them:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, you are looking for Jesus the
Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; he
is not here! Look! this is the place where his body was
laid; and you can see it is empty! But go, find his
disciples, and Peter, and tell them that he will go before
you into Galilee, to the mountains. There they will
see him, as he said to them before he died."</p>

<p>So these women, like Mary Magdalene only a few
minutes before, went away from the tomb to find some
of the disciples. They found Peter and John, and told
them the news that the angel had given to them.</p>

<p>Peter and John at once hurried to the tomb. John
was younger than Peter, and came to the tomb first.
He saw the stone rolled away and the tomb open, and
stood at the door, hesitating, uncertain whether to go
into the tomb or not. But Peter, who came a moment
afterward, did not hesitate. He rushed past John into
the tomb, and saw that it was empty. It was like
John, the thoughtful one, to wait at the door of the
tomb; and it was like Peter, the quick and hasty one,
to rush straight into the tomb. After Peter walked
into the tomb, John followed him inside. They saw
that the grave-place was empty; but they saw no
angel. John noticed that the grave-clothes were lying
in a heap on the floor, just as if Jesus had slipped out
of them, without unrolling the long bands; and that
the napkin which he had seen bound about his face
had been carefully folded and was lying by itself. All
these things showed that the body had not been taken
away suddenly or in haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Peter and John hurried to the tomb; seeing that it was empty they were
convinced that Jesus had risen.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter, the excitable, was not a thinker, and just
looked at these things and wondered. But John, the
thoughtful disciple, looked at these things&mdash;the stone
rolled away with its seal broken, the empty tomb, the
grave clothes in an orderly pile, and the napkin folded
carefully. Then it flashed upon his mind for the first
time that his Lord had risen alive from the tomb!
And at that moment came to him the words of Jesus
spoken more than once, that he must die, and on the
third day would rise again from death to life. Of all
the eleven disciples of Jesus&mdash;for now that Judas was
dead, they were no longer twelve, but eleven&mdash;John, the
disciple whom Jesus loved the most, was the first one
to believe that Jesus had risen, and he believed it before
he had seen his living Lord.</p>

<p>As yet no one had seen Jesus living. Two disciples
had looked into the empty tomb, and the women,
except Mary Magdalene, had seen the angel, but none
of them had seen Jesus; and all of them, save Mary
Magdalene, went away, wondering and scarcely knowing
what to think.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>




<h2>Jesus and Mary Magdalene</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 99</div>


<div class='cap'>All THE FOUR gospels agree in saying that the
first person who saw Jesus Christ living after his
death on the cross was Mary Magdalene; that is,
Mary of Magdala, a town on the Sea of Galilee; a woman
from whom a year before Jesus had driven out evil
spirits; and who in love for what Jesus had done to her,
followed him, and helped him with her gifts, for she was
a rich woman.</div>

<p>When the other women, with Peter and John, went
away from the tomb, Mary stayed there, weeping and
sobbing; for she had not seen the angel who said that
Jesus had risen, and did not know that he was alive.
As she stood weeping at the door of the tomb, she looked
inside. There she saw two angels sitting at the empty
grave-place, one at the head, the other at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had been lying.</p>

<p>"Woman," said one of the angels, "why are you
weeping?"</p>

<p>"Because they have taken away my Lord," answered
Mary, "and I do not know where they have laid him."</p>

<p>Just then something caused her to turn around,
and she saw a man standing near her. It was Jesus, but
she did not know him; for after rising from his grave
Jesus showed himself in differing forms, and people
could not know him until he allowed them.</p>

<p>"Woman," said Jesus to her, "why are you weeping?
Who is it that you are looking for?"</p>

<p>Mary thought that this strange man was the gardener.
She said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if you have carried him anywhere, tell me
where you have laid him, and I will take him away
myself."</p>

<p>"Mary!" said Jesus.</p>

<p>And as he spoke her name, she knew him; and fell at
his feet, clasping them in her hands.</p>

<p>"My own Master!" was all that she could say, in
her joy at seeing him alive once more, whom she had
last looked upon dead, hanging on the cross.</p>

<p>"Do not hold me," said Jesus, "for I have yet to
arise and go to my Father in heaven; but go to my
brothers, my disciples, and tell them that I shall soon
rise up from the earth and go to my Father and your
Father, to my God, and your God."</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene went and found the disciples, and
said to them, "I have seen the Lord!" telling them also
what he had said to her.</p>

<p>After Mary Magdalene had gone away from the
tomb, the other women&mdash;Mary the wife of Clopas,
Joanna, and Salome&mdash;came back from having seen the
disciples, and having told them what the angel had said,
that Jesus had risen. As they drew near the tomb, Jesus
went to meet them.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" he said to the women. They ran up
to him, fell on their faces, and clasped his feet, just as
Mary had done, for they felt joy and fear mingled as
they saw him.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said Jesus, "go tell my brothers
to go to Galilee and they shall see me there."</p>

<p>So these women went again to find the disciples and
give them the news that Jesus was really living, and that
they had seen him. All this was on Sunday morning&mdash;the
first Easter-day.</p>

<span class="caption">Mary Magdalene turned and answered the strange man whom she thought was
the gardener: &quot;Oh, sir, if you have carried him anywhere, tell me where
you have laid him.&quot; &quot;Mary!&quot; said Jesus. And as he spoke her name she
knew him.</span>
</div>

<p>On that morning, when the soldiers who had fled
from the tomb recovered from their terror, they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
to the chief priests and told them about the earthquake
and the angel who had rolled away the stone. The priests
had a talk with the rulers of the city; then they gave a
large sum of money to the soldiers, and told them to say
to everybody:</p>

<p>"The disciples came at night, while we were asleep,
and broke open the tomb, and stole the body of Jesus."</p>

<p>They knew that a soldier had no right to sleep while
on guard; and the rule of the army was, that any soldier
who slept on his post should be put to death. But the
rulers said to them:</p>

<p>"If the governor hears about this, we will satisfy
him, and see that no harm comes to you."</p>

<p>So the soldiers took their money and did as they
were told. And the story that the body of Jesus was
stolen from the tomb, was told among the Jewish people
and believed by them.</p>

<h2>A Walk with the Risen Christ</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 100</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN JESUS was seen after he rose from the
tomb, it was called an "appearance" because
Jesus appeared to someone. His first appearance,
as you have read, was to Mary Magdalene; his
second appearance was to the other women; and his
third appearance was to two men walking out into the
country on that first Easter morning.</div>

<p>Those two men were not among the twelve disciples
of Jesus; but they had believed in him as the Christ,
the King of Israel. One of them was named Cleopas;
the name of the other has not been given in the gospel
by Saint Luke, where this story is told. The two men
on that morning were walking out from Jerusalem to a
village called Emmaus, which was six or seven miles
from the city. As they walked, they talked together
of Jesus, of his death, his burial, and of a report which
had just come to them, that he was living again.</p>

<p>While they were walking and talking, they suddenly
saw another man walking with them. This stranger was
Jesus, but they did not know him; just as Mary Magdalene
did not know Jesus when first she saw him. He
said to them:</p>

<p>"What is it that you are talking about, as you walk
along?"</p>

<p>They stood still, with sorrowful faces; and Cleopas
answered this stranger.</p>

<p>"What!" said Cleopas, "do you live all alone in
Jerusalem, since you seem not to have heard of the things
that have taken place there in the last few days?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>"What things do you mean?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Why, about Jesus of Nazareth," they answered.
"Have you never heard of him? He was a wonderful
prophet, to whom God gave power in his words and his
deeds before all the people. But the chief priests and
our rulers seized him, and gave him up to be sentenced to
death, and crucified him. But it was our hope that he
was to be the one to set Israel free from its enemies, and
reign as our King. And now, this is the third day since
he died, and this morning some women of our company
have brought to us news that greatly surprised us. They
went to the tomb at daybreak, and found it open, but
did not find his body within it. They told us that they
had seen some angels, who said that Jesus was alive!
At once some of our men went to the tomb, and found
it just as the women had said, the tomb thrown open
and the body gone; but they did not see Jesus."</p>

<p>"O, foolish men, with hearts so slow to believe,
after all that the prophets have said in the Holy Book!"
said the stranger, who was the risen Jesus. "Do you not
know that Christ was bound to suffer all these things
before he could enter his glory as the Son of God?"</p>

<p>Then he began to show them in all the Old Testament
books, how Moses in the law, and David in the psalms,
and all the prophets in their writings, had foretold the
things that should take place with Christ when he should
come; and that all these things had come to pass with
Jesus, showing that Jesus of Nazareth was in truth the
Son of God and the King of Israel.</p>

<p>While they went on talking together, they drew
near the village of Emmaus, to which the two men were
going. The unknown Jesus seemed as if he was going
further; but they urged him to stop.</p>

<p>"Stay with us," they said to him, "for it is getting
toward evening; the sun is already about to set."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">

<span class="caption">After his resurrection Jesus appears to Simon Peter.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>And Jesus went with them to the village and into
the house. They sat down to supper; and the stranger
took the loaf of bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to
them. In that instant, their eyes were opened, and they
knew who he was, Jesus their Master! But in that
moment he vanished out of their sight.</p>

<p>"How our hearts burned within us," they said to
each other, "while he was talking to us on the road and
explaining to us what is said in the Holy Book!"</p>

<p>Then they immediately rose up from the table, and
went back in haste to Jerusalem. They found some of
the disciples and others in the upper room at Jerusalem,
where Jesus had taken his last supper with his disciples.
Before Cleopas and his friend found a chance to tell
their story, those in the room said to them:</p>

<p>"The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to
Simon Peter!"</p>

<p>Then the two men from Emmaus told how the
stranger had walked with them on the road, and had told
them many things out of the Old Testament; and how
they had suddenly known that he was Jesus, while he
was blessing and breaking the bread.</p>

<p>These were the third and fourth appearances of
Jesus, the third to Simon Peter; but what Jesus said to
him has not been written; and the fourth, to Cleopas
and his friend on the road to Emmaus.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>




<h2>Two Sunday Evenings with the
Risen Christ</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 101</div>


<div class='cap'>THE MEETING place of all who believed in Jesus,
after his death on the cross, seems to have been
the upstairs room, where Jesus had his last supper.
There they met from day to day; and it was to this
place that the two men came from Emmaus with the
report of their meeting with Jesus. On the evening of
Sunday, the first Easter day, the followers of Jesus
were gathered together in this room. Ten of the eleven
disciples of Christ were there, Thomas being absent;
and with them were the women and a number of others
who were believers in Jesus.</div>

<p>The doors leading to this room were shut and locked,
for they feared the Jewish rulers and people. They
were talking together of these reports that had come
to them of Jesus having risen and having been seen,
when all of a sudden they saw Jesus himself standing
in the middle of the room. He said to them:</p>

<p>"Peace be to you!"</p>

<p>At the first sight of him, they were frightened, for
they thought it was not Jesus alive whom they saw, but
the ghost or spirit of Jesus dead.</p>

<p>"Why are you so startled?" said Jesus to them,
"and why do doubts come to you? Look at my hands
and my feet. It is I, myself. Feel me, and look at me;
a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus-522.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">Jesus looked at Thomas and said to him: &quot;Look at my hands and put your
finger there, and look at my side and thrust your hand into it.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>With these words he showed them his hands and
his feet, with the holes left by the nails on the cross
still in them. Even yet, they felt the sight of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
was too good to be true, and could scarcely believe that
it was their Lord living. He said to them:</p>

<p>"Have you here anything to eat?"</p>

<p>They brought to him a piece of broiled fish; and
he ate it while they looked on. This was not because
he was hungry and needed food, for he no longer needed
anything; but simply to show them that he was really
living.</p>

<p>Then at last they were afraid no longer, and believed
fully that their Lord was with them living; and their
hearts were full of joy. Jesus said to them again:</p>

<p>"Peace be with you; as the Father sent me forth,
even so I send you forth."</p>

<p>Then he breathed on them, and said, "Receive the
Holy Spirit of God! I give you power that if you take
away the sins of men, they are taken away from them,
just as if I myself forgave them; and if you do not take
away their sins, then the guilt of their sins shall stay
upon them."</p>

<p>After talking with his followers for a time on that
evening, Jesus disappeared as suddenly as he had come.
This was his fifth appearance on that day, the day of
his rising from the tomb.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, Thomas, one of the twelve
disciples of Jesus, was not with the others on that evening,
and being absent did not meet the risen Jesus. The
other disciples said to him:</p>

<p>"We have seen the Lord!"</p>

<p>But Thomas would not believe them. He thought
that they were all mistaken, and said:</p>

<p>"Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails
on the cross, and put my finger on those marks of the
nails; and unless I can put my hand into the wound
made by the spear in his side, I will not believe that
he is alive!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later, on the next Sunday evening, they all
met again in the upper room; and at this time, Thomas
was present. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came
again and stood among them, with the words as before:
"Peace be with you!"</p>

<p>He looked at Thomas and said to him:</p>

<p>"Look at my hands, and put your finger there;
and look at my side, and thrust your hand into it. Do
not longer refuse to believe that I am alive, but believe
in me."</p>

<p>Thomas answered him: "My Lord, and my God!"</p>

<p>"Is it because you have seen me that you have
believed in me?" said Jesus. "Blessed are those who
have not seen, and yet have believed!"</p>

<p>You remember that John, the beloved disciple,
believed that Jesus had risen when he looked into the
empty tomb, and before he had seen him alive.</p>

<p>This meeting with the disciples on the second Sunday
evening was the sixth appearance of Jesus after
rising from the dead.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>




<h2>The Breakfast by the Sea</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 102</div>


<div class='cap'>ON THE NIGHT before the death of Jesus, at
the supper he had said to the twelve disciples,
"After I have risen from the dead, I will go
before you to Galilee." And after rising from his tomb,
he had said to the women, "Go and tell my disciples
that I will meet them on the mountain in Galilee."
This mountain was Kurn Hattin, near the Sea of Galilee,
where in the year before, he had preached his great
"Sermon on the Mount."</div>

<p>The word that Jesus would show himself to all
who believed on him, on this mountain in Galilee, led
the followers of Jesus from all parts of the land to go
to Galilee and to this mountain. They waited near
that place for some days without seeing Jesus.</p>

<p>One morning seven of the eleven disciples of Jesus
were on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. These seven
men were Simon Peter, James and John, Thomas,
Nathanael (who was also called Bartholomew, which
means "son of Tolmai"), and two other disciples, whose
names have not been given.</p>

<p>While they were standing by the lake, Peter felt
a longing for his old work as a fisherman, and he said
to the others:</p>

<p>"I am going fishing."</p>

<p>He thought that while they were waiting for Jesus
to come, they might also do some work. The other
six men said:</p>

<p>"We will go fishing with you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/illus-526.jpg" width="403" height="600" alt="painting" />
<span class="caption">At daybreak they saw a man standing on the shore, who called to them: &quot;Throw
out your net on the right side of the boat and you will
catch some fish.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>They went out in the boat, and fished all night, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
caught nothing. The next morning, just as the day
was breaking, they saw a man standing on the shore.</p>

<p>"Boys," called out this man, "have you caught
anything?"</p>

<p>"No," they answered him.</p>

<p>"Throw out your net on the right side of the boat,"
said the stranger, "and you will find some fish."</p>

<p>They threw out the net as the man told them, and
at once it was filled with large fish, so full that they
could not at first haul it in. Then John, the disciple
whom Jesus loved, said to Peter:</p>

<p>"That is our Lord!"</p>

<p>When Simon Peter heard that this man on the
shore was the Lord Jesus, he slipped on his coat&mdash;for
he had taken it off while working&mdash;and leaped into the
water to swim ashore. The other disciples came ashore
in a smaller boat, dragging the net, full of fish; for they
were not more than a hundred yards from the beach.</p>

<p>When they landed on the shore, they saw a charcoal
fire burning, with some fish cooking upon it and
some bread beside it. Jesus said:</p>

<p>"Bring some of the fish that you have caught."</p>

<p>Peter went to the boat and pulled the net ashore,
full of large fish. They counted them afterward, and
found that they numbered one hundred and fifty-three;
but although there were so many, the net was not torn
anywhere. Jesus said to them:</p>

<p>"Come and have breakfast."</p>

<p>They sat down on the beach beside the fire; and
Jesus passed the bread around to them, and also the
broiled fish. This was now the third time that Jesus
was seen by his disciples after rising from the dead;
for he had already appeared to them on two Sunday
evenings in Jerusalem; and in all, this was the seventh
appearance of Jesus after his rising from the dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had eaten their breakfast, and were
still sitting together, Jesus said to Simon Peter:</p>

<p>"Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than
the others?"</p>

<p>"Why, Master," answered Peter, "you know that
I am your friend."</p>

<p>"Then," said Jesus, "feed my lambs."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, and then Jesus a
second time asked Peter:</p>

<p>"Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master," he replied; "you know that I am
your friend."</p>

<p>"Then," said Jesus, "be a shepherd to my sheep."</p>

<p>Then, a third time, Jesus asked him:</p>

<p>"Simon, son of Jonas, are you my friend?"</p>

<p>Peter felt hurt that his third question was "Are
you my friend?" and not "Do you love me?" and he
answered:</p>

<p>"Master, you know everything! You know that
I am your friend!"</p>

<p>"Then feed my sheep," said Jesus; and he went
on, "I tell you in truth, when you were young you put
your own girdle around your waist, and went wherever
you chose. But when you grow old, you will stretch
out your hands for someone else to put a girdle around
you, and you will be taken where you do not wish to go."</p>

<p>Then Jesus added, "Follow me."</p>

<p>As Peter on the night of his Master's trial had three
times denied that he knew Jesus or was his disciple,
so now Jesus wished him to say three times before them
all that he was his friend. And when he had spoken
this three times, the Lord said to him, as he had said
long before by the Sea of Galilee, "Follow me." Thus
Simon Peter was again given his old place among the
disciples of Jesus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>What Jesus said to Peter about stretching out his
hands and being carried where he did not wish to go,
was spoken as a prophecy or foretelling of the manner
by which Peter should die for the sake of Christ. Nearly
forty years after that time, when Peter was an old man,
he was put to death at Rome by being crucified as Jesus
had been. It is said that when he was about to be
fastened upon the cross, he said to the soldiers, that one
who had denied his Master as he had, was not worthy
of dying in the same manner as Jesus had died; and
he begged them to set up his cross with his head downward
toward the ground; and thus Peter died.</p>

<p>But to go back to that breakfast by the Sea of
Galilee, after those words had been spoken by Jesus to
Peter, he looked at John, who was standing near. Peter
and John, though very different in their natures, loved
each other greatly. In the story of Jesus and his disciples,
and in the days that came after, we find that
almost always Peter and John were together. Seeing
John, Peter said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"Master, you have told me about myself; now tell
what this man shall do."</p>

<p>But Jesus said to Peter:</p>

<p>"If I choose that he shall wait until I come back
to earth, what has that to do with you? Do you follow
me, as I said."</p>

<p>John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, lived a long
time after that day. When all the rest of the twelve
disciples of Jesus had died&mdash;nearly all of them were slain
by enemies of Christ&mdash;John was still living. And from
these words of Jesus many thought that John would not
die. But Jesus did not say that John would not die.
He only said that if he chose to let John live until he,
Jesus, came again, it was not Peter's matter, but the
Lord's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<h2>Jesus Rising up from Earth to Heaven</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHAPTER 103</div>


<div class='cap'>SOON AFTER the appearance of Jesus to the seven
disciples by the Sea of Galilee, a great meeting was
held of many who believed in Jesus, on the mountain,
in Galilee, where Jesus had told them to come
together. It is said that at this meeting more than five
hundred people who were followers of Jesus gathered in
one place. There Jesus showed himself to the whole
company. When they saw him they bowed down to the
ground before him; but even then some of them were
in doubt whether they had really seen the Lord.</div>

<p>At that time Jesus drew near to this company and
said to them:</p>

<p>"All power as the Son of God, and the King of
God's Kingdom in heaven and on earth has been given to
me by my Father. I command you, therefore, to go
and preach the gospel to all the world, and make disciples
of all nations and in all lands. Those who believe on me,
baptize in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Spirit; and teach them to obey all the commands
that I have given you. Whoever believes on me as his
Saviour shall be saved from his sins; but whoever will
not believe, shall suffer the guilt of his sins. And these
powers shall be given to those who believe; in my name
they shall drive out evil spirits; they shall speak with
new tongues; they shall take up poisonous snakes in
their hands and shall suffer no harm; if they drink any
poison it shall not hurt them; they will place their
hands on sick people, and they shall become well. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
I will be with you all the time, even to the very end of
the world."</p>

<p>After this there was a ninth appearance of Jesus to
James; not James the brother of John, but another
James who was the son of Joseph and Mary, and a
younger brother of Jesus. What was said at that appearance
has not been told, but from that time James was
one of the foremost followers of Jesus, and for many
years a leader in the church at Jerusalem. Long after
this, James wrote one of the books in the New Testament,
the Epistle of James.</p>

<p>Jesus was seen from time to time during forty days
by his disciples and followers. We know of ten times
in all when Jesus appeared; but there may have been
other times of which no mention is made in the gospels
or in the other writings of the New Testament. His
tenth appearance, as far as we know, and his last, may
have been at the upper room in Jerusalem, forty days
after he had risen from his tomb. At that time he said:</p>

<p>"When I was with you, I told you this, that everything
written of me in the books of Moses, and the
psalms and the prophets must come to pass."</p>

<p>Then he opened their minds to understand what
was written in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>"Thus," he said, "it is written that Christ the King
of Israel must suffer, and die, and rise again the third
day, just as has come to pass. And now you are to go
forth and preach that men must everywhere turn from
their sins to God, and be forgiven of their sins through
the power given to me. And you are to begin your
preaching here in Jerusalem, the very place where I
have been crucified. I will soon send down on you the
Holy Spirit whom my Father has promised. But wait in
this city until the power comes upon you from on high."</p>

</div>

<p>Then the risen Christ led them out of the city to
the Mount of Olives. No one except those who believed
in him could see him, for he was unseen to all other
people. As he drew near Bethany he lifted up his hands
and blessed his followers. While they were looking at
him, and his hands were held out, he rose into the air,
higher and higher, until after a time a cloud covered
him from their sight, and Jesus the Lord of glory was
seen no more.</p>

<p>While they were looking upward, two men dressed
in shining white, angels of God, were seen standing
beside them. These angels said to the followers of
Jesus:</p>

<p>"Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking
up towards the heavens? This Jesus, who has been
taken from you, will come again to earth in the very
same way that you have seen him go up to heaven."</p>

<p>So Jesus Christ was taken up to heaven, and there
sat down on his throne at the right hand of God. He
sits there still, watching over his people until the day
shall come for him to return to earth.</p>
